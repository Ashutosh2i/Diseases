-----------------------PILES-----------------
<p><strong>Summary:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>PILES also called Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. PILES are usually caused by straining during bowel movements. Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. It has a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown. It can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids) and Thrombosed hemorrhoids. Piles, arise from a cushion of dilated arteriovenous blood vessels and connective tissue in the anal canal that may abnormally enlarge or protrude. Hemorrhoids are divided into three categories: internal ,external or mixed. PILES are caused by increased straining or intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., due to constipation, pregnancy, or extended periods of sitting). Patients may present with prolapse, rectal bleeding, pain, and pruritus.</p><p>CAUSES:-</p><p>The veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to:</p><ul><li>Straining during bowel movements</li><li>Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet</li><li>Having chronic diarrhea or constipation</li><li>Being obese</li><li>Being pregnant</li><li>Having anal intercourse</li><li>Eating a low-fiber diet</li><li>Regular heavy lifting</li></ul>

<p>Symptoms :-</p><p>Signs and symptoms of Piles usually depend on the type of Piles.</p><p><strong>External hemorrhoids:-</strong></p><p>These are under the skin around your anus. Signs and symptoms might include:</p><ul><li>Itching or irritation in your anal region</li><li>Pain or discomfort</li><li>Swelling around your anus</li><li>Bleeding</li></ul><p><strong>Internal hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause:</p><ul><li>Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet.</li><li>A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening (prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid), resulting in pain and irritation.</li></ul><p><strong>Thrombosed hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>If blood pools in an external hemorrhoid and forms a clot (thrombus), it can result in:</p><ul><li>Severe pain</li><li>Swelling</li><li>Inflammation</li><li>A hard lump near your anus</li></ul>

<p>TREATMENT:-</p><p><strong>Diet</strong>: Piles can occur due to straining during bowel movements. Excessive straining is the result of constipation. A change in diet can help keep the stools regular and soft. This involves eating more fiber, such as fruit and vegetables, or primarily eating bran-based breakfast cereals.A doctor may also advise the person with piles to increase their water consumption. It is best to avoid caffeine.</p><p><strong>Body weight</strong>: Losing weight may help reduce the incidence and severity of piles.To prevent piles, doctors also advise exercising and avoiding straining to pass stools. Exercising is one of the main therapies for piles.</p><h3><strong>Medications</strong></h3><p>Several medicinal options are available to make symptoms more manageable for an individual with piles.</p><p><strong>Over-the-counter (OTC) medications:</strong> Medications include painkillers, ointments, creams, and pads, and can help soothe redness and swelling around the anus.OTC remedies do not cure piles but can help the symptoms. Do not use them for more than 7 days in a row, as they can cause further irritation of the area and thinning of the skin. Do not use two or more medications at the same time unless advised to by a medical professional.</p><p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: These can reduce inflammation and pain.</p><p><strong>Laxatives</strong>: The doctor may prescribe laxatives if a person with piles suffers from constipation. These can help the person pass stools more easily and reduce pressure on the lower colon.</p><h3><strong>Surgical options</strong></h3><p>Around 1 in 10 people with piles will end up needing surgery.</p><p><strong>Banding</strong>: The doctor places an elastic band around the base of the pile, cutting off its blood supply. After a few days, hemorrhoid falls off. This is effective for treating all hemorrhoids of less than grade IV status.</p><p><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong>: Medicine is injected to make the hemorrhoid shrink. Hemorrhoid eventually shrivels up. This is effective for grade II and III hemorrhoids and is an alternative to banding.</p><p><strong>Infrared coagulation</strong>: Also referred to as infrared light coagulation, a device is used to burn the hemorrhoid tissue. This technique is used to treat grade I and II hemorrhoids.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoidectomy</strong>: The excess tissue that is causing the bleeding is surgically removed. This can be done in various ways and may involve a combination of a local anesthetic and sedation, a spinal anesthetic, or a general anesthetic. This type of surgery is the most effective for completely removing piles, but there is a risk of complications, including difficulties with passing stools, as well as urinary tract infections.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoid stapling</strong>: Blood flow is blocked to the hemorrhoid tissue. This procedure is usually less painful than hemorrhoidectomy. However, this procedure can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse, in which part of the rectum pushes out of the anus.</p>

-----------------------CONSTIPATION----------------

<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>Chronic constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools that persists for several weeks or longer. It is generally described as having fewer than three bowel movements a week. Constipation occurs when a person has difficulty emptying the large bowel. It&rsquo;s defined as having hard, dry bowel movements or going fewer than three times a week. Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause people to strain excessively in order to have a bowel movement.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><ul><li>Eating foods low in fiber.</li></ul><p>Low fiber foods include:</p><p>- high-fat foods, such as cheese, meat, and eggs</p><p>- highly processed foods, such as white bread</p><p>- fast foods, chips, and other premade foods</p><ul><li>Not drinking enough water (dehydration).</li><li>Not getting enough exercise.</li><li>Changes in your regular routine, such as traveling or eating or going to bed at different times.</li><li>Eating large amounts of milk or cheese.</li><li>Stress.</li><li>Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Passing fewer than three stools a week</li><li>Having lumpy or hard stools</li><li>Straining to have bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though there's a blockage in your rectum that prevents bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though you can't completely empty the stool from your rectum</li><li>Needing help to empty your rectum, such as using your hands to press on your abdomen and using a finger to remove stool from your rectum</li></ul><ul><li>Pain and cramping in the abdomen</li><li>Feeling bloated</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Loss of appetite</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><ul><li>Include plenty of high-fiber foods in your diet, including beans, vegetables, fruits, whole grain cereals, and bran.</li><li>Eat fewer foods with low amounts of fiber such as processed foods, and dairy and meat products.</li><li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li><li>Stay as active as possible and try to get regular exercise.</li><li>Try to manage stress.</li><li>Don't ignore the urge to pass stool.</li><li>Try to create a regular schedule for bowel movements, especially after a meal.</li><li>Make sure children who begin to eat solid foods get plenty of fiber in their diets.</li></ul><p>Laxatives can improve symptoms in the short-term, but people should use them with care and only when necessary because some laxatives can have severe adverse effects.</p><p><strong>Fiber supplements</strong>: Also known as bulk-forming laxatives, these may be the safest option. FiberCon is one example. People should take these with plenty of water.</p><p><strong>Stimulants</strong>: These cause the muscles in the intestines to contract rhythmically. Senokot is one example.</p><p><strong>Lubricants</strong>: These help the stool move smoothly through the colon. One example is mineral oil (Fleet).</p><p><strong>Stool softeners</strong>: These moisten the stool. Examples include Colace and Surfak.</p><p><strong>Osmotics</strong>: These draw water into the colon to hydrate the stool and ease movement. Saline laxatives are a type of osmotic.</p><p><strong>Neuromuscular agents</strong>: These include opioid antagonists and 5-HT4 agonists. They work at specific receptors to regulate movement through the gut</p><p>If constipation does not respond to treatment or if there are other symptoms, an abdominal imaging study such as a CT scan, MRI scan, or X-ray to see if there is a blockage due to an underlying disease process in the gut.</p>
