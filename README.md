<p><strong>Causes:</strong>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><h3><strong>Chemical exposure: </strong>The most common and dangerous chemical which can cause blood cancer is benzene. Exposure to heavy factory smoke and chemicals, formaldehyde etc., can also lead to blood cancer.</h3><h3><strong>Radiation exposure: </strong>Blood cancer can also happen because of exposure to radiation. Radiation of certain wavelengths can destroy the DNA and can cause cancer. Higher the dose of radiation, greater the risk of developing blood cancer. Exposure to radiation as a part of radiotherapy to cure cancers and to imaging tests can increase the risk of developing blood cancer.</h3><p><strong>Chronic inflammation: </strong>Chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. It is important to determine why and where the inflammation has occurred and which type of inflammation it is. This information contributes to the detection and diagnosis of blood cancer.</p><h3><strong>Genetics:</strong>There are some symptoms which are inherited syndromes. These syndromes directly impact higher possibilities of developing cancer. They include Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, down syndrome and a few more.</h3><p><strong>Smoking: </strong>This is one of the most crucial risk factors for blood cancer. The wide belief is that smoking causes lung or mouth cancer only, but it is one of the major contributors for blood cancer too. The tobacco can severely damage or change the DNA of blood cells which leads to abnormal growth and malfunctioning of the cell causing blood cancer.</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Today, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population do not follow a nutritious diet, a few foods, however, increase the risk of cancer. They are Processed meat, Microwave popcorn, Aerated drinks, Diet food and beverages, Refined flour, Refined sugars, Dirty fruits and vegetables, Farmed salmon, Hydrogenated oils.</p>
