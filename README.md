<p><strong>Causes:</strong>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><h3><strong>Chemical exposure: </strong>The most common and dangerous chemical which can cause blood cancer is benzene. Exposure to heavy factory smoke and chemicals, formaldehyde etc., can also lead to blood cancer.</h3><h3><strong>Radiation exposure: </strong>Blood cancer can also happen because of exposure to radiation. Radiation of certain wavelengths can destroy the DNA and can cause cancer. Higher the dose of radiation, greater the risk of developing blood cancer. Exposure to radiation as a part of radiotherapy to cure cancers and to imaging tests can increase the risk of developing blood cancer.</h3><p><strong>Chronic inflammation: </strong>Chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. It is important to determine why and where the inflammation has occurred and which type of inflammation it is. This information contributes to the detection and diagnosis of blood cancer.</p><h3><strong>Genetics:</strong>There are some symptoms which are inherited syndromes. These syndromes directly impact higher possibilities of developing cancer. They include Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, down syndrome and a few more.</h3><p><strong>Smoking: </strong>This is one of the most crucial risk factors for blood cancer. The wide belief is that smoking causes lung or mouth cancer only, but it is one of the major contributors for blood cancer too. The tobacco can severely damage or change the DNA of blood cells which leads to abnormal growth and malfunctioning of the cell causing blood cancer.</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Today, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population do not follow a nutritious diet, a few foods, however, increase the risk of cancer. They are Processed meat, Microwave popcorn, Aerated drinks, Diet food and beverages, Refined flour, Refined sugars, Dirty fruits and vegetables, Farmed salmon, Hydrogenated oils.</p>

<h3><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></h3><p>The most common tests used to diagnose blood cancer are:</p><ul><li><h3><strong><strong>Complete blood count</strong></strong></h3></li></ul><p>A complete blood count (CBC) is a commonly performed lab test that measures the number of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, and gives the amount of hemoglobin in the blood (hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen), and the percentage of blood that is RBCs.</p><p>Blood chemistry, which may also be called a chemistry panel, is commonly performed to measure a person&rsquo;s health status.

It is one of the most reliable treatments to cure blood cancer. These drugs travel along the bloodstream to reach the cancer cells. They then restrict the cells from spreading cancer further in the body. This treatment becomes one of the most effective ones because these drugs attack the cancer cells that are dividing quickly.</li><li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong><strong>:</strong> This form of cancer treatment uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. The therapy works by damaging the DNA in the cells, which restricts their growth and reproduction.</li><li>Stem cell transplantation: Healthy stem cells can be infused into your body to help resume healthy blood production following therapy to destroy malignant blood cells. When the blood cells are critically affected and the functioning of the body declines, the body needs more than getting rid of cancerous cells.</li><li><strong>Cancer Surgery</strong><strong>:</strong> This treatment involves removing the affected lymph nodes to treat some lymphomas.</li></ul><p>Life After Treatment:</p><ul><li>Re-entry to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life takes time and adjustment. Allow yourself and your family time to get used to being together again and appreciate that there will be setbacks and challenges.</li><li>Talk to someone who understands your situation. Perhaps someone who has been through a similar experience to yours.</li><li>Think about what is the best next step for you. For some going back to work gives a sense of being productive and useful again. For others, time to &lsquo;take stock&rsquo; or go on a holiday are the best ways to get back on top of things.</li><li>Understand that your friends or work colleagues may feel uncomfortable discussing your illness and that you may need to &lsquo;break the ice&rsquo; first.</li><li>You may benefit from counseling as well for your mental relaxation.</li></ul>

<p>Your blood, which accounts for about 8 percent of your normal body weight, plays an important role in how your body functions. When cancer occurs in the blood, it&rsquo;s usually the result of an abnormal and excessive reproduction of white blood cells. In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones. The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers.</p><p>Blood cancers account for about 10 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the U.S. each year.</p><p>There are three primary types of blood cancer:</p><p>Leukemia is a blood cancer that originates in the blood and bone marrow. It occurs when the body creates too many abnormal white blood cells and interferes with the bone marrow&rsquo;s ability to make red blood cells and platelets. It prevents white blood cells from fighting infections in your body. It&rsquo;s the most common blood cancer for children under the age of 15.</p><p>Lymphoma is a blood cancer that develops in the lymphatic system from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. It&rsquo;s the most common form of blood cancer in adults, accounting for over half of all diagnosed blood cancer cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Myeloma is a blood cancer that begins in the blood&rsquo;s plasma cells, a type of white blood cell made in the bone marrow. Myeloma affects your body&rsquo;s immune system, leaving it susceptible to infection. Doctors diagnose nearly 24,000 people in the United States with myeloma each year.</p>



--------------------------PROSTATE-----------------------------
<p>Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate &mdash; a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. It is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. The treatment is effective, especially in the early stages. Routine screening enables doctors to detect many cases of prostate cancer before they spread.</p><p>In fact, in 2019, the American Cancer Society (ACS) predict that there will be around 174,650 new diagnoses of prostate cancer and around 31,620 deaths.</p><p>Prostate cancer is also categorized by how fast it grows. It has two types of growths:</p><ul><li>Aggressive, or fast growing- the tumor can grow quickly and may spread to other areas of the body, such as the bones.</li><li>Non-aggressive, or slow growing - the tumor either doesn&rsquo;t grow or grows very little over time.</li></ul><h2>Causes:</h2><p>Researchers do not know exactly what causes prostate cancer. But they have found some risk factors and are trying to learn just how these factors might cause prostate cells to become cancer cells.</p><ul><li>a family history of prostate cancer</li><li>certain ethnicities or race &mdash; for instance, African American males are at greater risk of having prostate cancer</li><li>obesity</li><li>genetic changes</li><li>Age - as men age the risk goes up.</li></ul><p>Symptoms:</p><p>There are often no symptoms during the early stages of prostate cancer, but screening can detect changes that can indicate cancer. Prostate cancer that's more advanced may cause signs and symptoms such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>difficulty starting and maintaining urination</li></ul><ul><li>a frequent urge to urinate, especially at night</li><li>blood in the urine or semen</li><li>painful urination</li><li>in some cases, pain on ejaculation</li><li>difficulty getting or maintaining an erection</li><li>pain or discomfort when sitting, if the prostate is enlarged</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>Whether to test healthy men with no symptoms for prostate cancer is controversial. If you and your doctor decide that screening for prostate cancer is a good choice for you, your doctor will likely do a physical exam and discuss your health history. They&rsquo;ll also do one or more tests, which may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital rectal exam (DRE).</strong> During a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate, which is adjacent to the rectum. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture, shape or size of the gland, you may need further tests.</li><li><strong>Prostate </strong><strong>biopsy</strong><strong>: </strong>Your doctor may order a biopsy to help confirm a prostate cancer diagnosis. For a biopsy, a healthcare provider removes a small piece of your prostate gland for examination.</li><li><strong>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.</strong> A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA, a substance that's naturally produced by your prostate gland.</li><li><strong>Other tests: </strong>Your doctor may also do an MRI scan, CT scan, or bone scan.</li></ul><p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p><p>Your doctor will develop an appropriate treatment plan for your cancer based on your age, health status, and the stage of your cancer. If the cancer is nonaggressive, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting, which is also called active surveillance. This means you&rsquo;ll delay treatment but have regular checkups with your doctor to monitor the cancer. More aggressive types of cancer may be treated with other options, such as:</p><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiation</li><li>cryotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li><li>stereotactic radiosurgery</li></ul><ul><li>immunotherapy</li></ul><h3><strong>Effects on fertility</strong></h3><p>The prostate gland plays a role in sexual reproduction. Prostate cancer and many of its treatments affect fertility in several ways.</p><p>For example, if a male has surgery to remove either the prostate gland or the testicles, it will affect semen production and fertility.</p><p>Also, radiation therapy can affect prostate tissue, damaging sperm and reducing the amount of semen for transporting it.</p><p>Hormonal treatment can also affect fertility.</p><p>However, some options for preserving these functions include:</p><ul><li>banking sperm before surgery</li><li>extracting sperm directly from the testicles for artificial insemination</li></ul><p>However, there is no guarantee that fertility will remain intact after treatment for prostate cancer. Anyone who would like to have children after treatment should discuss fertility options with their doctor when they devise their treatment plan.</p>
