<p><strong>Causes:</strong>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><h3><strong>Chemical exposure: </strong>The most common and dangerous chemical which can cause blood cancer is benzene. Exposure to heavy factory smoke and chemicals, formaldehyde etc., can also lead to blood cancer.</h3><h3><strong>Radiation exposure: </strong>Blood cancer can also happen because of exposure to radiation. Radiation of certain wavelengths can destroy the DNA and can cause cancer. Higher the dose of radiation, greater the risk of developing blood cancer. Exposure to radiation as a part of radiotherapy to cure cancers and to imaging tests can increase the risk of developing blood cancer.</h3><p><strong>Chronic inflammation: </strong>Chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. It is important to determine why and where the inflammation has occurred and which type of inflammation it is. This information contributes to the detection and diagnosis of blood cancer.</p><h3><strong>Genetics:</strong>There are some symptoms which are inherited syndromes. These syndromes directly impact higher possibilities of developing cancer. They include Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, down syndrome and a few more.</h3><p><strong>Smoking: </strong>This is one of the most crucial risk factors for blood cancer. The wide belief is that smoking causes lung or mouth cancer only, but it is one of the major contributors for blood cancer too. The tobacco can severely damage or change the DNA of blood cells which leads to abnormal growth and malfunctioning of the cell causing blood cancer.</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Today, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population do not follow a nutritious diet, a few foods, however, increase the risk of cancer.

<h3><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></h3><p>The most common tests used to diagnose blood cancer are:</p><ul><li><h3><strong><strong>Complete blood count</strong></strong></h3></li></ul><p>A complete blood count (CBC) is a commonly performed lab test that measures the number of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, and gives the amount of hemoglobin in the blood (hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen), and the percentage of blood that is RBCs.</p><p>Blood chemistry, which may also be called a chemistry panel, is commonly performed to measure a person&rsquo;s health status.

It is one of the most reliable treatments to cure blood cancer. These drugs travel along the bloodstream to reach the cancer cells. They then restrict the cells from spreading cancer further in the body. This treatment becomes one of the most effective ones because these drugs attack the cancer cells that are dividing quickly.</li><li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong><strong>:</strong> This form of cancer treatment uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. The therapy works by damaging the DNA in the cells, which restricts their growth and reproduction.</li><li>Stem cell transplantation: Healthy stem cells can be infused into your body to help resume healthy blood production following therapy to destroy malignant blood cells. When the blood cells are critically affected and the functioning of the body declines, the body needs more than getting rid of cancerous cells.</li><li><strong>Cancer Surgery</strong><strong>:</strong> This treatment involves removing the affected lymph nodes to treat some lymphomas.</li></ul><p>Life After Treatment:</p><ul><li>Re-entry to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life takes time and adjustment. Allow yourself and your family time to get used to being together again and appreciate that there will be setbacks and challenges.</li><li>Talk to someone who understands your situation. Perhaps someone who has been through a similar experience to yours.</li><li>Think about what is the best next step for you. For some going back to work gives a sense of being productive and useful again. For others, time to &lsquo;take stock&rsquo; or go on a holiday are the best ways to get back on top of things.</li><li>Understand that your friends or work colleagues may feel uncomfortable discussing your illness and that you may need to &lsquo;break the ice&rsquo; first.</li><li>You may benefit from counseling as well for your mental relaxation.</li></ul>

------------------SUMMARY--------------------
<p>Your blood, which accounts for about 8 percent of your normal body weight, plays an important role in how your body functions. When cancer occurs in the blood, it&rsquo;s usually the result of an abnormal and excessive reproduction of white blood cells. In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones. The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers.</p><p>Blood cancers account for about 10 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the U.S. each year.</p><p>There are three primary types of blood cancer:</p><p>Leukemia is a blood cancer that originates in the blood and bone marrow. It occurs when the body creates too many abnormal white blood cells and interferes with the bone marrow&rsquo;s ability to make red blood cells and platelets. It prevents white blood cells from fighting infections in your body. It&rsquo;s the most common blood cancer for children under the age of 15.</p><p>Lymphoma is a blood cancer that develops in the lymphatic system from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. It&rsquo;s the most common form of blood cancer in adults, accounting for over half of all diagnosed blood cancer cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Myeloma is a blood cancer that begins in the blood&rsquo;s plasma cells, a type of white blood cell made in the bone marrow. Myeloma affects your body&rsquo;s immune system, leaving it susceptible to infection. Doctors diagnose nearly 24,000 people in the United States with myeloma each year.</p>



--------------------------PROSTATE-----------------------------
<p>Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate &mdash; a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. It is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. The treatment is effective, especially in the early stages. Routine screening enables doctors to detect many cases of prostate cancer before they spread.</p><p>In fact, in 2019, the American Cancer Society (ACS) predict that there will be around 174,650 new diagnoses of prostate cancer and around 31,620 deaths.</p><p>Prostate cancer is also categorized by how fast it grows. It has two types of growths:</p><ul><li>Aggressive, or fast growing- the tumor can grow quickly and may spread to other areas of the body, such as the bones.</li><li>Non-aggressive, or slow growing - the tumor either doesn&rsquo;t grow or grows very little over time.</li></ul><h2>Causes:</h2><p>Researchers do not know exactly what causes prostate cancer. But they have found some risk factors and are trying to learn just how these factors might cause prostate cells to become cancer cells.</p><ul><li>a family history of prostate cancer</li><li>certain ethnicities or race &mdash; for instance, African American males are at greater risk of having prostate cancer</li><li>obesity</li><li>genetic changes</li><li>Age - as men age the risk goes up.</li></ul><p>Symptoms:</p><p>There are often no symptoms during the early stages of prostate cancer, but screening can detect changes that can indicate cancer. Prostate cancer that's more advanced may cause signs and symptoms such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>difficulty starting and maintaining urination</li></ul><ul><li>a frequent urge to urinate, especially at night</li><li>blood in the urine or semen</li><li>painful urination</li><li>in some cases, pain on ejaculation</li><li>difficulty getting or maintaining an erection</li><li>pain or discomfort when sitting, if the prostate is enlarged</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>Whether to test healthy men with no symptoms for prostate cancer is controversial. If you and your doctor decide that screening for prostate cancer is a good choice for you, your doctor will likely do a physical exam and discuss your health history. They&rsquo;ll also do one or more tests, which may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital rectal exam (DRE).</strong> During a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate, which is adjacent to the rectum. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture, shape or size of the gland, you may need further tests.</li><li><strong>Prostate </strong><strong>biopsy</strong><strong>: </strong>Your doctor may order a biopsy to help confirm a prostate cancer diagnosis. For a biopsy, a healthcare provider removes a small piece of your prostate gland for examination.</li><li><strong>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.</strong> A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA, a substance that's naturally produced by your prostate gland.</li><li><strong>Other tests: </strong>Your doctor may also do an MRI scan, CT scan, or bone scan.</li></ul><p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p><p>Your doctor will develop an appropriate treatment plan for your cancer based on your age, health status, and the stage of your cancer. If the cancer is nonaggressive, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting, which is also called active surveillance. This means you&rsquo;ll delay treatment but have regular checkups with your doctor to monitor the cancer. More aggressive types of cancer may be treated with other options, such as:</p><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiation</li><li>cryotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li><li>stereotactic radiosurgery</li></ul><ul><li>immunotherapy</li></ul><h3><strong>Effects on fertility</strong></h3><p>The prostate gland plays a role in sexual reproduction. Prostate cancer and many of its treatments affect fertility in several ways.</p><p>For example, if a male has surgery to remove either the prostate gland or the testicles, it will affect semen production and fertility.</p><p>Also, radiation therapy can affect prostate tissue, damaging sperm and reducing the amount of semen for transporting it.</p><p>Hormonal treatment can also affect fertility.</p><p>However, some options for preserving these functions include:</p><ul><li>banking sperm before surgery</li><li>extracting sperm directly from the testicles for artificial insemination</li></ul><p>However, there is no guarantee that fertility will remain intact after treatment for prostate cancer. Anyone who would like to have children after treatment should discuss fertility options with their doctor when they devise their treatment plan.</p>



-----------------LUNG--------------------------
<p>Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the U.S. and worldwide. Cigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for the development of lung cancer. In lung cancer, this pattern of cell overgrowth occurs in the lungs, which are vital organs for breathing and gas exchange. Lung cancers typically start in the cells lining the bronchi and parts of the lung such as the bronchioles or alveoli. There are 2 main types of lung cancer and they are treated very differently.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</strong>: makes up about 80 to 85 percent of all cases. This type usually forms in the outer part of the lungs (adenocarcinomas). Another 30 percent of cases begin in cells that line the passages of the respiratory tract&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)</strong>: It represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. SCLC grows and spreads faster than NSCLC. This also makes it more likely to respond to chemotherapy. However, it&rsquo;s also less likely to be cured with treatment.</li></ul><p><strong>Causes:</strong></p><p>Anyone can get lung cancer, but 90 percent of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking. From the moment you inhale smoke into your lungs, it starts damaging your lung tissue. The lungs can repair the damage, but continued exposure to smoke makes it increasingly difficult for the lungs to keep up the repair. Other risk factors for lung cancer include:</p><ul><li>Exposure to secondhand smoke.&nbsp;</li><li>Previous radiation therapy.</li><li>Exposure to radon gas.&nbsp;</li><li>Exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens</li><li>Family history of lung cancer.</li><li>Lung disease</li></ul><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>In people with lung cancer, symptoms do not always occur until the condition has reached a later stage. Early symptoms may include:</p><ul><li>lingering or worsening cough</li><li>coughing up phlegm or blood</li><li>chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough</li><li>hoarseness</li><li>shortness of breath</li><li>wheezing</li><li>weakness and fatigue</li><li>loss of appetite and weight loss</li></ul><p>As cancer spreads, additional symptoms depend on where new tumors form. For example, if in the:</p><ul><li>lymph nodes: lumps, particularly in the neck or collarbone</li><li>bones: bone pain, particularly in the back, ribs, or hips</li><li>brain or spine: headache, dizziness, balance issues, or numbness in arms or legs</li><li>liver: yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>People with an increased risk of lung cancer may consider annual lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scans. Lung cancer screening is generally offered to people 55 and older who smoked heavily for many years or who have quit in the past 15 years. Doctors use a wide range of diagnostic procedures and tests to diagnose lung cancer. These include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> It may reveal the presence of symptoms or signs that are suspicious for lung cancer. In addition to asking about symptoms and risk factors for cancer development such as smoking, doctors may detect signs of breathing difficulties, airway obstruction, or infections in the lungs.</li><li><strong>Imaging tests:</strong> An X-ray image of your lungs may reveal an abnormal mass or nodule. A CT scan can reveal small lesions in your lungs that might not be detected on an X-ray.</li><li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>MRI</strong><strong>):</strong> MRI scans may be appropriate when precise detail about a tumor's location is required. The MRI technique uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures.</li><li><strong>Tissue sampling:</strong> If a doctor identifies a suspicious lesion on an imaging study, they may recommend taking a sample of lung tissue to test for potentially cancerous cells.</li><li><strong>Sputum cytology.</strong> If you have a cough and are producing sputum, looking at the sputum under the microscope can sometimes reveal the presence of lung cancer cells.</li><li><strong>Bone Scan: </strong>&nbsp;Doctors may order a bone scan to determine whether lung cancer has metastasized to the bones. In a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream and collects in the bones, especially in abnormal areas such as those involved by metastatic tumors.</li></ul><p>Doctors assign a stage to NSCLC from I to IV in order of severity:</p><ul><li>In stage I, the cancer is confined to the lung.</li><li>In stages II and III, the cancer is confined to the chest (with larger and more invasive tumors classified as stage III).</li><li>Stage IV cancer has spread from the chest to other parts of the body.</li></ul><p><strong>Treatment:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Treatments for lung cancer depend on its location and stage, as well as the overall health of the individual.</p><p>Surgery and radiation are the most common approaches to treating lung cancer, but other treatments are available. For example, doctors often treat small cell lung cancer with chemotherapy.</p><p><strong>Surgery</strong>: During surgery, your surgeon works to remove lung cancer and a margin of healthy tissue. Your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes from your chest in order to check them for signs of cancer. Surgery may be an option if your cancer is confined to the lungs. If you have larger lung cancer, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy or radiation therapy before surgery in order to shrink cancer.</p><p><strong>Radiation:</strong> Radiation therapy treats both NSCLC and SCLC. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill dividing cancer cells. Medical professionals deliver the radiation either externally, by using a machine that directs radiation toward cancer, or internally through the placement of radioactive substances in sealed containers within the area of the body where the tumor is localized.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chemotherapy: </strong>This treatment uses drugs to shrink or eradicate cancer cells. These medications target rapidly dividing cells, which makes them ideal for treating cancer. Chemotherapy treatment has a more significant impact on cancers that have spread to different parts of the body and require a body-wide attack. However, it is a powerful intervention and can have side effects including extreme nausea and weight loss. With chemotherapy, their survival time is increased up to four- to fivefold.</p><p><strong>Targeted therapy</strong>: This is the use of particular medications that specifically target a particular behavior in cancer cells. Examples include medicines that stop cancer cells from multiplying.</p><h3><strong>Immunotherapy: </strong>Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.</h3><h2><strong>Lifestyle and home remedies</strong></h2><p>Home remedies and homeopathic remedies won&rsquo;t cure cancer. But certain home remedies may help relieve some of the symptoms associated with lung cancer and side effects of treatment.</p><ul><li><strong>Try to relax.</strong> Feeling short of breath can be scary. But fear and anxiety only make it harder to breathe. When you begin to feel short of breath, try to manage the fear by choosing an activity that helps you relax. Listen to music, imagine your favorite vacation spot, meditate, or say a prayer.</li><li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Relaxation and reflection can reduce stress and improve the overall quality of life in cancer patients.</li><li><strong>Acupuncture.</strong> During an acupuncture session, a trained practitioner inserts small needles into precise points on your body. Acupuncture may relieve pain and ease cancer treatment side effects</li><li><strong>Hypnosis:</strong> Helps you relax and may help with nausea, pain, and anxiety.</li><li><strong>Yoga.</strong> Yoga combines gentle stretching movements with deep breathing and meditation. Yoga may help people with cancer sleep better.</li></ul>



------------------SKIN-------------------------------------
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Skin cancer - the abnormal growth of skin cells in the epidermis(the superficial layer of the skin) - most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. The vast majority of these sorts of skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening. The main types of skin cancer are:</p><ul><li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)</strong>: These are abnormal, uncontrolled growths that arise from the skin&rsquo;s basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis). These cancers most often develop on skin areas typically exposed to the sun, especially the face, ears, neck, scalp, shoulders, and back. It is the most common form of skin cancer, with more than 4 million cases diagnosed in the United States each year.</li><li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): It</strong>is a common form of skin cancer that develops in the squamous cells that make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. it is usually not life-threatening, though it can be aggressive. Untreated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of your body, causing serious complications.</li><li><strong>Melanoma</strong>: Melanoma is cancer that develops from melanocytes, the skin cells that produce melanin pigment, which gives skin its color. Melanomas often resemble moles and sometimes may arise from them. They can be found in any area of the body, even in areas that are not typically exposed to the sun. Melanoma is the most dangerous of the three most common forms of skin cancer. Melanomas can be curable when caught and treated early.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC):</strong> These tumors usually appear as firm, painless lesions or nodules on a sun-exposed area (about half of the time on the head and neck, and frequently on the eyelids). MCCs are believed to begin in Merkel cells at the base of the epidermis. They most often arise in sun-exposed areas in fair-skinned individuals over age 50. MCCs are at high risk of recurring and metastasizing throughout the body, so early detection and treatment are crucial.</li></ul><p><strong>Causes:</strong></p><p>Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. The most common risk factors for skin cancer are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Ultraviolet light exposure:</strong>Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. Fair-skinned individuals, with hazel or blue eyes, and people with blond or red hair are particularly vulnerable. The problem is worse in areas of high elevation or near the equator where sunlight exposure is more intense.</li><li><strong>Exposure to radiation.</strong> People who received radiation treatment for skin conditions such as eczema and acne may have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma.</li><li><strong>Radiation (X-rays): </strong>Exposure to ionizing radiation (X-rays) or chemicals known to predispose to cancer such as arsenic</li><li><strong>A family history of skin cancer.</strong> If one of your parents or a sibling has had skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease.</li><li><strong>A personal history of skin cancer.</strong> If you developed skin cancer once, you're at risk of developing it again.</li><li><strong>Weakened Immune System: </strong>A chronically suppressed immune system (immunosuppression) from underlying diseases such as HIV/AIDS infection or cancer, or from some medications such as prednisone or chemotherapy</li><li><strong>Precancerous skin lesions.</strong> Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. These precancerous skin growths typically appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to dark pink.</li></ul><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day - your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area.</p><p><strong>Basal cell carcinomas:</strong></p><ul><li>Appearance of a shiny pink, red, pearly, or translucent bump</li><li>Pink skin growths or lesions with raised borders that are crusted in the center</li><li>A raised reddish patch of skin that may crust or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm">itch</a>, but is usually not painful</li><li>A pearly or waxy bump</li></ul><p><strong>Squamous cell carcinomas:</strong></p><ul><li>Persistent, scaly red patches with irregular borders that may bleed easily</li><li>Open sore that does not go away for weeks</li><li>A raised growth with a rough surface that is indented in the middle</li><li>A wart-like growth</li></ul><p><strong>Melanoma:</strong></p><ul><li>A large brownish spot with darker speckles</li><li>A mole that changes in color, size or feels or that bleeds</li><li>A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black</li><li>A painful lesion that itches or burns</li><li>Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>A skin examination by a dermatologist is the way to get a definitive diagnosis of skin cancer. In many cases, the appearance alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis. To diagnose skin cancer, your doctor may:</p><ul><li><strong>Examine your skin.</strong> Your doctor may look at your skin to determine whether your skin changes are likely to be skin cancer. Further testing may be needed to confirm that diagnosis.</li><li><strong>Remove a sample of suspicious skin for testing (skin biopsy).</strong> Your doctor may remove the suspicious-looking skin for lab testing. A biopsy can determine whether you have skin cancer and, if so, what type of skin cancer you have.</li></ul><p>If your doctor determines you have skin cancer, you may have additional tests to determine the extent (stage) of the skin cancer. Additional tests might include imaging tests to examine the nearby lymph nodes for signs of cancer or a procedure to remove a nearby lymph node and test it for signs of cancer.</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p><p>There are several effective means of treating skin cancer. The choice of therapy depends on the location and size of the tumor, the microscopic characteristics of cancer, and the general health of the patient.</p><p><strong>Cryotherapy</strong>: Your doctor may destroy actinic keratoses and some small, early skin cancers by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery). The dead tissue sloughs off when it thaws.</p><p><strong>Excisional surgery:</strong> This type of treatment may be appropriate for any type of skin cancer. Your doctor cuts out (excises) the cancerous tissue and a surrounding margin of healthy skin. A wide excision &mdash; removing extra normal skin around the tumor &mdash; may be recommended in some cases.</p><p><strong>Mohs surgery</strong><strong>: </strong>The growth is removed layer by layer, and each layer is examined under a microscope until no abnormal cells are visible.</p><p><strong>Radiation therapy</strong><strong>:</strong> Ten to fifteen treatment sessions deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor and a small surrounding skin area. This form of treatment is useful in those who are not candidates for any surgical procedure. The advantage of radiation therapy is that there is no cutting involved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photodynamic therapy</strong><strong>:</strong> A laser light and drugs are used to destroy the cancer cells.</p><p><strong>Immunotherapy</strong>: A cream is applied to your skin to stimulate your immune system to kill the cancer cells.</p><p><strong>chemotherapy: </strong>Drugs are taken orally, applied topically or injected with a needle or IV line to kill the cancer cells.</p><p><strong>Preventing skin cancer</strong></p><ul><li>Many skin cancers can be prevented by avoiding triggers that cause tumors to develop. Prevention strategies include protection from the sun by the use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during the peak hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li><li>Do not use tanning beds, which are a major cause of excess ultraviolet light exposure and a significant risk factor for skin cancer.</li><li>Apply sunscreen and lip balm with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher to any exposed skin at least 30 minutes before heading outdoors and reapply regularly.</li><li>Wear a wide-brimmed hat and dry, dark, tightly woven fabrics when you&rsquo;re outside during daylight hours.</li><li>Wear sunglasses that offer 100 percent UVB and UVA protection.</li><li>It&rsquo;s also important to regularly examine your skin for changes like new growths or spots.</li></ul>



------------------LIVER-----------------
<p>The liver is the largest glandular organ in the body and performs various critical functions to keep the body free of toxins and harmful substances. Liver cancer is cancer that starts in the liver. Some cancers develop outside the liver and spread to the organ, but doctors only describe cancer that starts in the liver as liver cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>It is generally classified as primary or secondary. Primary liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver. Secondary liver cancer develops when cancer cells from another organ spread to the liver. Unlike other cells in the body, cancer cells can break away from the primary site, or where cancer began. The cancer cells can then become destructive to adjacent normal tissues and can spread both to other areas of the liver and to organs outside the liver. Liver cancer is also called hepatic cancer.</p><p>Causes:</p><p>According to the ACS, chronic infections with hepatitis B or C viruses are the most common causes of liver cancer in the U.S.</p><ul><li><strong>Age: </strong>Liver cancer is more common in people over age 50.</li><li><strong>Heavy alcohol use</strong>: Consuming more than six alcoholic drinks every day for an extended period can lead to cirrhosis. This, in turn, increases the risk of liver cancer.</li><li><strong>Low immunity</strong>: People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS have a risk of liver cancer that is five times greater than other healthy individuals.</li><li><strong>Obesity: </strong>Being obese raises the risk of developing many cancers. In people who go on to develop liver cancer, obesity can contribute to cirrhosis and fatty liver disease</li><li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Both former and current smokers have a higher risk of liver cancer than people who have never smoked.</li><li><strong>History of diabetes:</strong> Studies have suggested a link between diabetes and liver cancer. This is likely due to the link between diabetes and fatty liver disease.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include:</p><ul><li>jaundice, where the skin and eyes become yellow</li><li>abdominal pain</li><li>pain close to the right shoulder blade</li><li>unexplained weight loss</li><li>an enlarged liver, spleen, or both</li><li>swelling in the abdomen or fluid buildup</li><li>fatigue</li><li>nausea</li><li>vomiting</li><li>back pain</li><li>itching</li><li>fever</li><li>a full feeling after a small meal</li><li>white, chalky stools</li></ul><h2><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></h2><p>The diagnosis of liver cancer begins with a medical history and a physical examination. Make sure to tell your doctor if you have a history of long-term alcohol abuse or a chronic hepatitis B or C infection. If a doctor suspects liver cancer, they will request further tests. These may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> These include tests for blood clotting, levels of other substances in the blood, and proportions of red and white blood cells and platelets.</li><li><strong>Imaging studies:</strong> Multiphasic helical CT scan and MRI with contrast of the liver are the preferred imaging for detecting the location and extent of blood supply to the cancer.</li><li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> A surgeon removes a small sample of tumor tissue for analysis. The results can reveal whether the tumor is cancerous or noncancerous.</li><li><strong>Laparoscopy:</strong> This is an outpatient surgical procedure that takes place under general or local anesthetic. A surgeon inserts a long, flexible tube with a camera attached through a cut in the abdomen. The camera allows the doctor to see the liver and the surrounding area.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>Treatment for liver cancer varies. It depends on:</p><ul><li>the number, size, and location of the tumors in the liver</li><li>how well the liver is functioning</li><li>whether cirrhosis is present</li><li>whether the tumor has spread to other organs</li></ul><p>Your specific treatment plan will be based on these factors. Liver cancer treatments may include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Liver cancer can be treated sometimes with surgery to remove the part of the liver with cancer. Surgical options are reserved for the smaller sizes of cancer tumors.</li><li><p><strong>Liver Transplant: </strong>A liver transplant involves replacing the entire diseased liver with a healthy liver from a suitable donor. A transplant can only be done if cancer hasn&rsquo;t spread to other organs.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Localized treatments: </strong>Localized treatments for liver cancer are those that are administered directly to the cancer cells or the area surrounding the cancer cells. These include - <strong>Heating cancer cells, Freezing cancer cells, Injecting alcohol into the tumor, Injecting chemotherapy drugs into the liver, Placing beads filled with radiation in the liver.</strong></p></li></ul><h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2><p>Liver cancer has a low survival rate in comparison to some other cancers. However, people can reduce their risk of experiencing the disease. They can also improve their chances of early detection.</p><ul><li>Moderating alcohol intake: Regularly consuming high volumes of alcohol on a long term basis significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.</li><li>Limiting tobacco use: This can help avoid cancer of the liver, especially in people who have hepatitis B and C.</li><li>Having a hepatitis B vaccination: The following people should consider having the hepatitis vaccine</li><li>Obesity is a risk factor as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer and diabetes.</li></ul>
