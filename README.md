-----------------------PILES-----------------
<p><strong>Summary:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>PILES also called Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. PILES are usually caused by straining during bowel movements. Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. It has a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown. It can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids) and Thrombosed hemorrhoids. Piles, arise from a cushion of dilated arteriovenous blood vessels and connective tissue in the anal canal that may abnormally enlarge or protrude. Hemorrhoids are divided into three categories: internal ,external or mixed. PILES are caused by increased straining or intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., due to constipation, pregnancy, or extended periods of sitting). Patients may present with prolapse, rectal bleeding, pain, and pruritus.</p><p>CAUSES:-</p><p>The veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to:</p><ul><li>Straining during bowel movements</li><li>Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet</li><li>Having chronic diarrhea or constipation</li><li>Being obese</li><li>Being pregnant</li><li>Having anal intercourse</li><li>Eating a low-fiber diet</li><li>Regular heavy lifting</li></ul>

<p>Symptoms :-</p><p>Signs and symptoms of Piles usually depend on the type of Piles.</p><p><strong>External hemorrhoids:-</strong></p><p>These are under the skin around your anus. Signs and symptoms might include:</p><ul><li>Itching or irritation in your anal region</li><li>Pain or discomfort</li><li>Swelling around your anus</li><li>Bleeding</li></ul><p><strong>Internal hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause:</p><ul><li>Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet.</li><li>A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening (prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid), resulting in pain and irritation.</li></ul><p><strong>Thrombosed hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>If blood pools in an external hemorrhoid and forms a clot (thrombus), it can result in:</p><ul><li>Severe pain</li><li>Swelling</li><li>Inflammation</li><li>A hard lump near your anus</li></ul>

<p>TREATMENT:-</p><p><strong>Diet</strong>: Piles can occur due to straining during bowel movements. Excessive straining is the result of constipation. A change in diet can help keep the stools regular and soft. This involves eating more fiber, such as fruit and vegetables, or primarily eating bran-based breakfast cereals.A doctor may also advise the person with piles to increase their water consumption. It is best to avoid caffeine.</p><p><strong>Body weight</strong>: Losing weight may help reduce the incidence and severity of piles.To prevent piles, doctors also advise exercising and avoiding straining to pass stools. Exercising is one of the main therapies for piles.</p><h3><strong>Medications</strong></h3><p>Several medicinal options are available to make symptoms more manageable for an individual with piles.</p><p><strong>Over-the-counter (OTC) medications:</strong> Medications include painkillers, ointments, creams, and pads, and can help soothe redness and swelling around the anus.OTC remedies do not cure piles but can help the symptoms. Do not use them for more than 7 days in a row, as they can cause further irritation of the area and thinning of the skin. Do not use two or more medications at the same time unless advised to by a medical professional.</p><p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: These can reduce inflammation and pain.</p><p><strong>Laxatives</strong>: The doctor may prescribe laxatives if a person with piles suffers from constipation. These can help the person pass stools more easily and reduce pressure on the lower colon.</p><h3><strong>Surgical options</strong></h3><p>Around 1 in 10 people with piles will end up needing surgery.</p><p><strong>Banding</strong>: The doctor places an elastic band around the base of the pile, cutting off its blood supply. After a few days, hemorrhoid falls off. This is effective for treating all hemorrhoids of less than grade IV status.</p><p><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong>: Medicine is injected to make the hemorrhoid shrink. Hemorrhoid eventually shrivels up. This is effective for grade II and III hemorrhoids and is an alternative to banding.</p><p><strong>Infrared coagulation</strong>: Also referred to as infrared light coagulation, a device is used to burn the hemorrhoid tissue. This technique is used to treat grade I and II hemorrhoids.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoidectomy</strong>: The excess tissue that is causing the bleeding is surgically removed. This can be done in various ways and may involve a combination of a local anesthetic and sedation, a spinal anesthetic, or a general anesthetic. This type of surgery is the most effective for completely removing piles, but there is a risk of complications, including difficulties with passing stools, as well as urinary tract infections.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoid stapling</strong>: Blood flow is blocked to the hemorrhoid tissue. This procedure is usually less painful than hemorrhoidectomy. However, this procedure can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse, in which part of the rectum pushes out of the anus.</p>

-----------------------CONSTIPATION----------------

<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>Chronic constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools that persists for several weeks or longer. It is generally described as having fewer than three bowel movements a week. Constipation occurs when a person has difficulty emptying the large bowel. It&rsquo;s defined as having hard, dry bowel movements or going fewer than three times a week. Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause people to strain excessively in order to have a bowel movement.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><ul><li>Eating foods low in fiber.</li></ul><p>Low fiber foods include:</p><p>- high-fat foods, such as cheese, meat, and eggs</p><p>- highly processed foods, such as white bread</p><p>- fast foods, chips, and other premade foods</p><ul><li>Not drinking enough water (dehydration).</li><li>Not getting enough exercise.</li><li>Changes in your regular routine, such as traveling or eating or going to bed at different times.</li><li>Eating large amounts of milk or cheese.</li><li>Stress.</li><li>Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Passing fewer than three stools a week</li><li>Having lumpy or hard stools</li><li>Straining to have bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though there's a blockage in your rectum that prevents bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though you can't completely empty the stool from your rectum</li><li>Needing help to empty your rectum, such as using your hands to press on your abdomen and using a finger to remove stool from your rectum</li></ul><ul><li>Pain and cramping in the abdomen</li><li>Feeling bloated</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Loss of appetite</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><ul><li>Include plenty of high-fiber foods in your diet, including beans, vegetables, fruits, whole grain cereals, and bran.</li><li>Eat fewer foods with low amounts of fiber such as processed foods, and dairy and meat products.</li><li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li><li>Stay as active as possible and try to get regular exercise.</li><li>Try to manage stress.</li><li>Don't ignore the urge to pass stool.</li><li>Try to create a regular schedule for bowel movements, especially after a meal.</li><li>Make sure children who begin to eat solid foods get plenty of fiber in their diets.</li></ul><p>Laxatives can improve symptoms in the short-term, but people should use them with care and only when necessary because some laxatives can have severe adverse effects.</p><p><strong>Fiber supplements</strong>: Also known as bulk-forming laxatives, these may be the safest option. FiberCon is one example. People should take these with plenty of water.</p><p><strong>Stimulants</strong>: These cause the muscles in the intestines to contract rhythmically. Senokot is one example.</p><p><strong>Lubricants</strong>: These help the stool move smoothly through the colon. One example is mineral oil (Fleet).</p><p><strong>Stool softeners</strong>: These moisten the stool. Examples include Colace and Surfak.</p><p><strong>Osmotics</strong>: These draw water into the colon to hydrate the stool and ease movement. Saline laxatives are a type of osmotic.</p><p><strong>Neuromuscular agents</strong>: These include opioid antagonists and 5-HT4 agonists. They work at specific receptors to regulate movement through the gut</p><p>If constipation does not respond to treatment or if there are other symptoms, an abdominal imaging study such as a CT scan, MRI scan, or X-ray to see if there is a blockage due to an underlying disease process in the gut.</p>


-----------------------FISTULA---------------------------------------

<p>SUMMARY:-</p><p>A <strong>fistula</strong> is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces such as blood vessels, intestines, or other hollow organs. Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery, but they can also result from an infection or inflammation. Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but they may be surgically created for therapeutic reasons. A fistula is a tunnel that runs from inside the anus the hole your body uses to get rid of solid waste to somewhere in the skin around it. It usually follows an infection that didn&rsquo;t heal the right way. Fistulas form when inflammation causes sores or <strong>ulcers </strong>to form on the inside wall of the intestine or nearby organs. These ulcers can extend through the entire thickness of the bowel wall, creating a tunnel to drain the pus from the infected area. An abscess, or a collection of pus, can also cause a fistula to form.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Inside your anus are several glands that make fluid. Sometimes they get blocked or clogged. When that happens a bacteria buildup can create a swollen pocket of infected tissue and liquid. Doctors call this an abscess. If you don&rsquo;t treat the abscess it&rsquo;ll grow. Eventually, it&rsquo;ll make its way to the outside and punch a hole in the skin somewhere near your anus so the gunk inside it can drain. The fistula is the tunnel that connects the gland to that opening. Most of the time an abscess causes a fistula. It&rsquo;s rare but they can also come from conditions like sexually transmitted diseases or an ongoing illness that affects your bowels.</p><p>other causes are -</p><ul><li>Chrons disease (an inflammatory disease of the intestine)</li><li>Radiation (treatment for cancer)</li><li>Trauma.</li><li>Sexually transmitted diseases.</li><li>Tuberculosis.</li><li>Diverticulitis (a disease in which small pouches form in the large intestine and become inflamed)</li></ul>

<p><strong>SYMPTOMS:-</strong></p><p>Patients can have different symptoms depending on which parts of the body are connected by the fistula.</p><p><strong>Fistula between the small and large intestine</strong></p><ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Passage of undigested food</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula between the intestine and the bladder</strong></p><ul><li>Urinary tract infection</li><li>Burning with urination</li><li>Cloudy urine or blood in the urine</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula between the intestine and the vagina</strong></p><ul><li>Passage of gas or stool through the vagina</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula from the intestine to the skin</strong></p><ul><li>Can initially present as a painful bump or boil</li><li>Skin abscess that is open and draining fluid or stool</li></ul><p>You can also notice</p><ul><li>Pain</li><li>Redness</li><li>Swelling around your anus</li><li>Bleeding</li><li>Painful bowel movements or urination</li><li>Fever</li><li>A foul-smelling liquid oozing from a hole near your anus</li></ul>

<p><strong>Treatment:-</strong></p><p><strong>Surgery is usually necessary to treat an anal fistula as they usually do not heal by themselves.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes you may need to have an initial examination of area under general anaesthetic to determine best treatment</strong></p><h2><strong>Types of surgery:-</strong></h2><h2><strong>Fistulotomy -</strong></h2><ul><li>The most common type of surgery for anal fistulas is a fistulotomy. This involves cutting along the whole length of the fistula to open it up so it heals as a flat scar.</li><li>A fistulotomy is the most effective treatment for many anal fistulas, although it's usually only suitable for fistulas that do not pass through much of the sphincter muscles, as the risk of incontinence is lowest in these cases.</li><li>If the surgeon has to cut a small portion of anal sphincter muscle during the procedure, they'll make every attempt to reduce the risk of incontinence.</li><li>In cases where the risk of incontinence is considered too high, another procedure may be recommended instead.</li></ul><h2><strong>Seton techniques -</strong></h2><ul><li>If your fistula passes through a significant portion of the anal sphincter muscle, the surgeon may initially recommend inserting a seton.</li><li>A seton is a piece of surgical thread that's left in the fistula for several weeks to keep it open.</li><li>This allows it to drain and helps it heal while avoiding the need to cut the sphincter muscles.</li><li>Loose setons allow fistulas to drain but do not cure them. To cure a fistula, tighter setons may be used to cut through the fistula slowly.</li></ul><h2><strong>Advancement flap procedure -</strong></h2><ul><li>An advancement flap procedure may be considered if your fistula passes through the anal sphincter muscles and having a fistulotomy carries a high risk of causing incontinence.</li><li>This involves cutting or scraping out the fistula and covering the hole where it entered the bowel with a flap of tissue taken from inside the rectum, which is the final part of the bowel.</li><li>This has a lower success rate than a fistulotomy, but avoids the need to cut the anal sphincter muscles.</li></ul><h2><strong>LIFT procedure -</strong></h2><ul><li>The ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure is a treatment for fistulas that pass through the anal sphincter muscles, where a fistulotomy would be too risky.</li><li>During the treatment, a cut is made in the skin above the fistula and the sphincter muscles are moved apart. The fistula is then sealed at both ends and cut open so it lies flat.</li><li>This procedure has had some promising results so far, but it's only been around for a few years, so more research is needed to determine how well it works in the short and long term.</li></ul><h2><strong>Endoscopic ablation-</strong></h2><ul><li>In this procedure, an endoscope (a tube with a camera on the end) is put in the fistula.</li><li>An electrode is then passed through the endoscope and used to seal the fistula.</li><li>Endoscopic ablation works well and there are no serious concerns about its safety.</li></ul><h2><strong>Laser surgery</strong></h2><ul><li>Radially emitting laser fibre treatment involves using a small laser beam to seal the fistula.</li><li>There are uncertainties around how well it works, but there are no major safety concerns.</li></ul>

--------FISSURE-------

<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age.&nbsp;The crack in the skin causes severe pain and some bright red bleeding during and after bowel movements. At times the fissure can be deep enough to expose the muscle tissue underneath. An anal fissure usually isn&rsquo;t a serious condition. It can affect people of all ages and it&rsquo;s often seen in infants and young children since constipation is a common problem in these age groups.</p><p>In most cases, the tear heals on its own within four to six weeks. In cases where the fissure persists beyond eight weeks, it&rsquo;s considered chronic. Certain treatments can promote healing and help relieve discomfort, including stool softeners and topical pain relievers. If an anal fissure doesn&rsquo;t improve with these treatments you may need surgery..</p><p><strong>CAUSES:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Anal fissure most often occurs when passing large or hard stools. Chronic constipation or frequent diarrhea can also tear the skin around your anus. Other common causes include:</p><ul><li>straining during childbirth or bowel movements</li><li>inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's&nbsp;disease</li><li>decreased blood flow to the anorectal area</li><li>overly tight or spastic anal sphincter muscles</li><li>Passing large or hard stools</li><li>Constipation and straining during bowel movements</li></ul><ul><li>constipation.:- Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.</li><li>Childbirth:- Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.</li><li>Crohn's disease:- This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.</li><li>Anal intercourse.</li><li>Age. Anal fissures can occur at any age but are more common in infants and middle-aged adults</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Pain, sometimes severe during bowel movements</li><li>Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours</li><li>Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement</li><li>Visible crack in the skin around the anus</li><li>&nbsp;Small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure</li><li>Visible tear in the skin around your anus</li><li>&nbsp;Sharp pain in the anal area during bowel movements</li><li>Streaks of blood on stools or toilet paper after wiping</li><li>Burning or itching in the anal area</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><p><strong>You can treat an anal fissure at home by:</strong></p><ul><li>Using over the counter stool softeners.</li><li>Drinking more fluids.</li><li>Taking fiber supplements and eating more fibrous foods such as raw fruits and vegetables.</li><li>Taking a sitz bath to relax the anal muscles, relieve irritation, and increase blood flow to the anorectal area.</li><li>Applying a nitroglycerin ointment to promote blood flow to the area or&nbsp;hydrocortisone cream, such as Cortizone 10 to help with inflammation.</li><li>Applying topical pain relievers, such as lidocaine, to the anus to ease discomfort.</li></ul><ul><li>A calcium channel blocker ointment can relax the sphincter muscles and allow the anal fissure to heal.</li><li>Botox injections into the anal sphincter. The injections will prevent spasms in your anus by temporarily paralyzing the muscle. This allows the anal fissure to heal while preventing new fissures from forming.</li><li>Anal sphincterotomy:- This surgical procedure involves making a small incision in the anal sphincter to relax the muscle. Relaxing the muscle allows the anal fissure to heal.</li></ul><p><strong>PREVENTIVE MEASURES:--</strong></p><ul><li>Keeping the anal area dry.</li><li>Cleansing the anal area gently with mild soap and warm water</li><li>Drinking plenty of fluids, eating fibrous foods, and exercising regularly to avoid constipation.</li><li>Treating diarrhea immediately.</li><li>Changing an infant's diapers frequently.</li></ul>
