<p>Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer, affecting approximately 68,000 adults in the United States, approximately 48,000 men and 19,000 women per year are diagnosed with the disease. Nearly 81000 people will be diagnosed in the US with bladder cancer in 2020. Bladder cancer is an uncontrolled abnormal growth and multiplication of cells in the urinary bladder, it most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder and ) has the ability to spread to other body parts, including the lungs, bones, and liver. About seven out of every 10 bladder cancers diagnosed start out at an early stage when bladder cancer is highly treatable.</p>


<p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
<p>Rather than grow and divide in an orderly way, cancer cells develop mutations that cause them to grow out of control and not die. These abnormal cells form a tumor. Doctors aren&rsquo;t sure. But they do know that several things increase your risk for the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>How do you know that you may have bladder cancer? Some people may have symptoms suggesting the cancer and some may not. Signs and symptoms in early stage may include.</p><ul><li>blood in the urine</li><li>painful urination</li><li>frequent urination</li><li>urgent urination</li><li>urinary incontinence</li><li>pain in the abdominal area</li><li>pain in the lower back</li></ul><p>Patients may have signs and symptoms of more advanced disease such as</p><ul><li>a distended bladder (due to obstruction by a tumor at the bladder neck),</li><li>an inability to pass any urine,</li><li>pain in the flanks (due to obstruction of urine flow from kidney to the bladder by the growing tumor mass in the bladder),</li><li>bone pains,</li><li>foot and/or ankle swelling, or</li><li>cough/blood in the phlegm (due to spread to cancer cells to bones or lungs).</li></ul>


<p><strong>Diagnosis:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Tests and procedures used to diagnose bladder cancer may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Physical Exam</strong>: the first thing your doctor probably will do is a complete medical history. He&rsquo;ll ask you about your overall health, as well as anything that increases your risk, like having a family member who had bladder cancer. If your doctor finds something that&rsquo;s not normal, after pelvic exam or digital rectal exam, he&rsquo;ll order lab tests.</li><li><strong>Urine cytology:</strong> A sample of your urine is analyzed under a microscope to check for cancer cell</li><li><strong>Ultrasound</strong>: An ultrasound examination of the bladder can detect bladder tumors. It can also detect the presence of swelling in the kidneys in case the bladder tumor&nbsp;</li><li><strong>CT scan</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>MRI</strong><strong>:</strong> It provides greater visual detail than an ultrasound exam and may detect smaller tumors in the kidneys or bladder than can be detected by an ultrasound.</li><li><strong>Cystoscopy:</strong> To perform cystoscopy, your doctor inserts a small, narrow tube (cystoscope) through the urethra. The cystoscope has a lens that allows your doctor to see the inside of your urethra and bladder</li><li><strong>Biopsy: </strong>During cystoscopy, your doctor may pass a special tool through the scope and into your bladder to collect a cell sample (biopsy) for testing.</li></ul><p>Your doctor can rate bladder cancer with a staging system that goes from stages 0 to 4 to identify how far the cancer has spread. The stages of bladder cancer mean the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 0 </strong>bladder cancer hasn&rsquo;t spread past the lining of the bladder.</li><li><strong>Stage 1 </strong>bladder cancer has spread past the lining of the bladder, but it hasn&rsquo;t reached the layer of muscle in the bladder.</li><li><strong>Stage 2 </strong>bladder cancer has spread to the layer of muscle in the bladder.</li><li><strong>Stage 3 </strong>bladder cancer has spread into the tissues that surround the bladder.</li><li><strong>Stage 4</strong> bladder cancer has spread past the bladder to the neighboring areas of the body</li></ul>
