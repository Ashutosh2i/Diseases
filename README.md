-----------------------PILES-----------------
<p><strong>Summary:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>PILES also called Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. PILES are usually caused by straining during bowel movements. Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. It has a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown. It can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids) and Thrombosed hemorrhoids. Piles, arise from a cushion of dilated arteriovenous blood vessels and connective tissue in the anal canal that may abnormally enlarge or protrude. Hemorrhoids are divided into three categories: internal ,external or mixed. PILES are caused by increased straining or intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., due to constipation, pregnancy, or extended periods of sitting). Patients may present with prolapse, rectal bleeding, pain, and pruritus.</p><p>CAUSES:-</p><p>The veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to:</p><ul><li>Straining during bowel movements</li><li>Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet</li><li>Having chronic diarrhea or constipation</li><li>Being obese</li><li>Being pregnant</li><li>Having anal intercourse</li><li>Eating a low-fiber diet</li><li>Regular heavy lifting</li></ul>

<p>Symptoms :-</p><p>Signs and symptoms of Piles usually depend on the type of Piles.</p><p><strong>External hemorrhoids:-</strong></p><p>These are under the skin around your anus. Signs and symptoms might include:</p><ul><li>Itching or irritation in your anal region</li><li>Pain or discomfort</li><li>Swelling around your anus</li><li>Bleeding</li></ul><p><strong>Internal hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause:</p><ul><li>Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet.</li><li>A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening (prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid), resulting in pain and irritation.</li></ul><p><strong>Thrombosed hemorrhoids :-</strong></p><p>If blood pools in an external hemorrhoid and forms a clot (thrombus), it can result in:</p><ul><li>Severe pain</li><li>Swelling</li><li>Inflammation</li><li>A hard lump near your anus</li></ul>

<p>TREATMENT:-</p><p><strong>Diet</strong>: Piles can occur due to straining during bowel movements. Excessive straining is the result of constipation. A change in diet can help keep the stools regular and soft. This involves eating more fiber, such as fruit and vegetables, or primarily eating bran-based breakfast cereals.A doctor may also advise the person with piles to increase their water consumption. It is best to avoid caffeine.</p><p><strong>Body weight</strong>: Losing weight may help reduce the incidence and severity of piles.To prevent piles, doctors also advise exercising and avoiding straining to pass stools. Exercising is one of the main therapies for piles.</p><h3><strong>Medications</strong></h3><p>Several medicinal options are available to make symptoms more manageable for an individual with piles.</p><p><strong>Over-the-counter (OTC) medications:</strong> Medications include painkillers, ointments, creams, and pads, and can help soothe redness and swelling around the anus.OTC remedies do not cure piles but can help the symptoms. Do not use them for more than 7 days in a row, as they can cause further irritation of the area and thinning of the skin. Do not use two or more medications at the same time unless advised to by a medical professional.</p><p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: These can reduce inflammation and pain.</p><p><strong>Laxatives</strong>: The doctor may prescribe laxatives if a person with piles suffers from constipation. These can help the person pass stools more easily and reduce pressure on the lower colon.</p><h3><strong>Surgical options</strong></h3><p>Around 1 in 10 people with piles will end up needing surgery.</p><p><strong>Banding</strong>: The doctor places an elastic band around the base of the pile, cutting off its blood supply. After a few days, hemorrhoid falls off. This is effective for treating all hemorrhoids of less than grade IV status.</p><p><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong>: Medicine is injected to make the hemorrhoid shrink. Hemorrhoid eventually shrivels up. This is effective for grade II and III hemorrhoids and is an alternative to banding.</p><p><strong>Infrared coagulation</strong>: Also referred to as infrared light coagulation, a device is used to burn the hemorrhoid tissue. This technique is used to treat grade I and II hemorrhoids.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoidectomy</strong>: The excess tissue that is causing the bleeding is surgically removed. This can be done in various ways and may involve a combination of a local anesthetic and sedation, a spinal anesthetic, or a general anesthetic. This type of surgery is the most effective for completely removing piles, but there is a risk of complications, including difficulties with passing stools, as well as urinary tract infections.</p><p><strong>Hemorrhoid stapling</strong>: Blood flow is blocked to the hemorrhoid tissue. This procedure is usually less painful than hemorrhoidectomy. However, this procedure can lead to an increased risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse, in which part of the rectum pushes out of the anus.</p>

-----------------------CONSTIPATION----------------

<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>Chronic constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools that persists for several weeks or longer. It is generally described as having fewer than three bowel movements a week. Constipation occurs when a person has difficulty emptying the large bowel. It&rsquo;s defined as having hard, dry bowel movements or going fewer than three times a week. Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause people to strain excessively in order to have a bowel movement.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><ul><li>Eating foods low in fiber.</li></ul><p>Low fiber foods include:</p><p>- high-fat foods, such as cheese, meat, and eggs</p><p>- highly processed foods, such as white bread</p><p>- fast foods, chips, and other premade foods</p><ul><li>Not drinking enough water (dehydration).</li><li>Not getting enough exercise.</li><li>Changes in your regular routine, such as traveling or eating or going to bed at different times.</li><li>Eating large amounts of milk or cheese.</li><li>Stress.</li><li>Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Passing fewer than three stools a week</li><li>Having lumpy or hard stools</li><li>Straining to have bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though there's a blockage in your rectum that prevents bowel movements</li><li>Feeling as though you can't completely empty the stool from your rectum</li><li>Needing help to empty your rectum, such as using your hands to press on your abdomen and using a finger to remove stool from your rectum</li></ul><ul><li>Pain and cramping in the abdomen</li><li>Feeling bloated</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Loss of appetite</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><ul><li>Include plenty of high-fiber foods in your diet, including beans, vegetables, fruits, whole grain cereals, and bran.</li><li>Eat fewer foods with low amounts of fiber such as processed foods, and dairy and meat products.</li><li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li><li>Stay as active as possible and try to get regular exercise.</li><li>Try to manage stress.</li><li>Don't ignore the urge to pass stool.</li><li>Try to create a regular schedule for bowel movements, especially after a meal.</li><li>Make sure children who begin to eat solid foods get plenty of fiber in their diets.</li></ul><p>Laxatives can improve symptoms in the short-term, but people should use them with care and only when necessary because some laxatives can have severe adverse effects.</p><p><strong>Fiber supplements</strong>: Also known as bulk-forming laxatives, these may be the safest option. FiberCon is one example. People should take these with plenty of water.</p><p><strong>Stimulants</strong>: These cause the muscles in the intestines to contract rhythmically. Senokot is one example.</p><p><strong>Lubricants</strong>: These help the stool move smoothly through the colon. One example is mineral oil (Fleet).</p><p><strong>Stool softeners</strong>: These moisten the stool. Examples include Colace and Surfak.</p><p><strong>Osmotics</strong>: These draw water into the colon to hydrate the stool and ease movement. Saline laxatives are a type of osmotic.</p><p><strong>Neuromuscular agents</strong>: These include opioid antagonists and 5-HT4 agonists. They work at specific receptors to regulate movement through the gut</p><p>If constipation does not respond to treatment or if there are other symptoms, an abdominal imaging study such as a CT scan, MRI scan, or X-ray to see if there is a blockage due to an underlying disease process in the gut.</p>


-----------------------FISTULA---------------------------------------

<p>SUMMARY:-</p><p>A <strong>fistula</strong> is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces such as blood vessels, intestines, or other hollow organs. Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery, but they can also result from an infection or inflammation. Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but they may be surgically created for therapeutic reasons. A fistula is a tunnel that runs from inside the anus the hole your body uses to get rid of solid waste to somewhere in the skin around it. It usually follows an infection that didn&rsquo;t heal the right way. Fistulas form when inflammation causes sores or <strong>ulcers </strong>to form on the inside wall of the intestine or nearby organs. These ulcers can extend through the entire thickness of the bowel wall, creating a tunnel to drain the pus from the infected area. An abscess, or a collection of pus, can also cause a fistula to form.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Inside your anus are several glands that make fluid. Sometimes they get blocked or clogged. When that happens a bacteria buildup can create a swollen pocket of infected tissue and liquid. Doctors call this an abscess. If you don&rsquo;t treat the abscess it&rsquo;ll grow. Eventually, it&rsquo;ll make its way to the outside and punch a hole in the skin somewhere near your anus so the gunk inside it can drain. The fistula is the tunnel that connects the gland to that opening. Most of the time an abscess causes a fistula. It&rsquo;s rare but they can also come from conditions like sexually transmitted diseases or an ongoing illness that affects your bowels.</p><p>other causes are -</p><ul><li>Chrons disease (an inflammatory disease of the intestine)</li><li>Radiation (treatment for cancer)</li><li>Trauma.</li><li>Sexually transmitted diseases.</li><li>Tuberculosis.</li><li>Diverticulitis (a disease in which small pouches form in the large intestine and become inflamed)</li></ul>

<p><strong>SYMPTOMS:-</strong></p><p>Patients can have different symptoms depending on which parts of the body are connected by the fistula.</p><p><strong>Fistula between the small and large intestine</strong></p><ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Passage of undigested food</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula between the intestine and the bladder</strong></p><ul><li>Urinary tract infection</li><li>Burning with urination</li><li>Cloudy urine or blood in the urine</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula between the intestine and the vagina</strong></p><ul><li>Passage of gas or stool through the vagina</li></ul><p><strong>Fistula from the intestine to the skin</strong></p><ul><li>Can initially present as a painful bump or boil</li><li>Skin abscess that is open and draining fluid or stool</li></ul><p>You can also notice</p><ul><li>Pain</li><li>Redness</li><li>Swelling around your anus</li><li>Bleeding</li><li>Painful bowel movements or urination</li><li>Fever</li><li>A foul-smelling liquid oozing from a hole near your anus</li></ul>

<p><strong>Treatment:-</strong></p><p><strong>Surgery is usually necessary to treat an anal fistula as they usually do not heal by themselves.</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes you may need to have an initial examination of area under general anaesthetic to determine best treatment</strong></p><h2><strong>Types of surgery:-</strong></h2><h2><strong>Fistulotomy -</strong></h2><ul><li>The most common type of surgery for anal fistulas is a fistulotomy. This involves cutting along the whole length of the fistula to open it up so it heals as a flat scar.</li><li>A fistulotomy is the most effective treatment for many anal fistulas, although it's usually only suitable for fistulas that do not pass through much of the sphincter muscles, as the risk of incontinence is lowest in these cases.</li><li>If the surgeon has to cut a small portion of anal sphincter muscle during the procedure, they'll make every attempt to reduce the risk of incontinence.</li><li>In cases where the risk of incontinence is considered too high, another procedure may be recommended instead.</li></ul><h2><strong>Seton techniques -</strong></h2><ul><li>If your fistula passes through a significant portion of the anal sphincter muscle, the surgeon may initially recommend inserting a seton.</li><li>A seton is a piece of surgical thread that's left in the fistula for several weeks to keep it open.</li><li>This allows it to drain and helps it heal while avoiding the need to cut the sphincter muscles.</li><li>Loose setons allow fistulas to drain but do not cure them. To cure a fistula, tighter setons may be used to cut through the fistula slowly.</li></ul><h2><strong>Advancement flap procedure -</strong></h2><ul><li>An advancement flap procedure may be considered if your fistula passes through the anal sphincter muscles and having a fistulotomy carries a high risk of causing incontinence.</li><li>This involves cutting or scraping out the fistula and covering the hole where it entered the bowel with a flap of tissue taken from inside the rectum, which is the final part of the bowel.</li><li>This has a lower success rate than a fistulotomy, but avoids the need to cut the anal sphincter muscles.</li></ul><h2><strong>LIFT procedure -</strong></h2><ul><li>The ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure is a treatment for fistulas that pass through the anal sphincter muscles, where a fistulotomy would be too risky.</li><li>During the treatment, a cut is made in the skin above the fistula and the sphincter muscles are moved apart. The fistula is then sealed at both ends and cut open so it lies flat.</li><li>This procedure has had some promising results so far, but it's only been around for a few years, so more research is needed to determine how well it works in the short and long term.</li></ul><h2><strong>Endoscopic ablation-</strong></h2><ul><li>In this procedure, an endoscope (a tube with a camera on the end) is put in the fistula.</li><li>An electrode is then passed through the endoscope and used to seal the fistula.</li><li>Endoscopic ablation works well and there are no serious concerns about its safety.</li></ul><h2><strong>Laser surgery</strong></h2><ul><li>Radially emitting laser fibre treatment involves using a small laser beam to seal the fistula.</li><li>There are uncertainties around how well it works, but there are no major safety concerns.</li></ul>

--------FISSURE-------

<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age.&nbsp;The crack in the skin causes severe pain and some bright red bleeding during and after bowel movements. At times the fissure can be deep enough to expose the muscle tissue underneath. An anal fissure usually isn&rsquo;t a serious condition. It can affect people of all ages and it&rsquo;s often seen in infants and young children since constipation is a common problem in these age groups.</p><p>In most cases, the tear heals on its own within four to six weeks. In cases where the fissure persists beyond eight weeks, it&rsquo;s considered chronic. Certain treatments can promote healing and help relieve discomfort, including stool softeners and topical pain relievers. If an anal fissure doesn&rsquo;t improve with these treatments you may need surgery..</p><p><strong>CAUSES:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Anal fissure most often occurs when passing large or hard stools. Chronic constipation or frequent diarrhea can also tear the skin around your anus. Other common causes include:</p><ul><li>straining during childbirth or bowel movements</li><li>inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's&nbsp;disease</li><li>decreased blood flow to the anorectal area</li><li>overly tight or spastic anal sphincter muscles</li><li>Passing large or hard stools</li><li>Constipation and straining during bowel movements</li></ul><ul><li>constipation.:- Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.</li><li>Childbirth:- Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.</li><li>Crohn's disease:- This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.</li><li>Anal intercourse.</li><li>Age. Anal fissures can occur at any age but are more common in infants and middle-aged adults</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Pain, sometimes severe during bowel movements</li><li>Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours</li><li>Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement</li><li>Visible crack in the skin around the anus</li><li>&nbsp;Small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure</li><li>Visible tear in the skin around your anus</li><li>&nbsp;Sharp pain in the anal area during bowel movements</li><li>Streaks of blood on stools or toilet paper after wiping</li><li>Burning or itching in the anal area</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><p><strong>You can treat an anal fissure at home by:</strong></p><ul><li>Using over the counter stool softeners.</li><li>Drinking more fluids.</li><li>Taking fiber supplements and eating more fibrous foods such as raw fruits and vegetables.</li><li>Taking a sitz bath to relax the anal muscles, relieve irritation, and increase blood flow to the anorectal area.</li><li>Applying a nitroglycerin ointment to promote blood flow to the area or&nbsp;hydrocortisone cream, such as Cortizone 10 to help with inflammation.</li><li>Applying topical pain relievers, such as lidocaine, to the anus to ease discomfort.</li></ul><ul><li>A calcium channel blocker ointment can relax the sphincter muscles and allow the anal fissure to heal.</li><li>Botox injections into the anal sphincter. The injections will prevent spasms in your anus by temporarily paralyzing the muscle. This allows the anal fissure to heal while preventing new fissures from forming.</li><li>Anal sphincterotomy:- This surgical procedure involves making a small incision in the anal sphincter to relax the muscle. Relaxing the muscle allows the anal fissure to heal.</li></ul><p><strong>PREVENTIVE MEASURES:--</strong></p><ul><li>Keeping the anal area dry.</li><li>Cleansing the anal area gently with mild soap and warm water</li><li>Drinking plenty of fluids, eating fibrous foods, and exercising regularly to avoid constipation.</li><li>Treating diarrhea immediately.</li><li>Changing an infant's diapers frequently.</li></ul>



---------------------HERNIA------------------
<p><strong>SUMMARY:-</strong></p><p>A hernia occurs when an internal organ or other body part protrudes through the wall of muscle or tissue that normally contains it. Most hernias occur within the abdominal cavity, between the chest and the hips.</p><p>The most common forms of hernia are:</p><p><strong>Inguinal hernia</strong>:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;In men, the inguinal canal is a passageway for the spermatic cord and blood vessels leading to the testicles.</li><li>&nbsp;In women, the inguinal canal contains the round ligament that gives support for the womb. In an inguinal hernia, fatty tissue or a part of the intestine pokes into the groin at the top of the inner thigh.</li><li>This is the most common type of hernia and affects men more often than women.</li></ul><p><strong>Femoral hernia</strong>:</p><ul><li>Fatty tissue or part of the intestine protrudes into the groin at the top of the inner thigh.</li><li>Femoral hernias are much less common than inguinal hernias and mainly affect older women.</li></ul><p><strong>Umbilical hernia</strong>:</p><p>Fatty tissue or part of the intestine pushes through the abdomen near the navel (belly button).</p><ul><li><strong>Hiatal (hiatus) hernia</strong>: Part of the stomach pushes up into the chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm (the horizontal sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen).</li></ul><p>Other types of hernias include:</p><ul><li><strong>Incisional hernia</strong>: Tissue protrudes through the site of an abdominal scar from a remote abdominal or pelvic operation.</li><li><strong>Epigastric hernia</strong>: Fatty tissue protrudes through the abdominal area between the navel and lower part of the sternum (breastbone).</li><li><strong>Spigelian hernia</strong>: The intestine pushes through the abdomen at the side of the abdominal muscle, below the navel.</li><li><strong>Diaphragmatic hernia</strong>: Organs in the abdomen move into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm.</li></ul><p>Of all hernias that occur:</p><ul><li>75&ndash;80% are inguinal or femoral</li><li>2% are incisional or ventral</li><li>3&ndash;10% are umbilical, affecting 10-20% of newborns;</li><li>1&ndash;3% are other types</li></ul><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><ul><li>Straining on the toilet (due to long-term constipation )</li><li>Persistent cough</li><li>Cystic fibrosis</li><li>Enlarged prostate</li><li>Straining to urinate</li><li>Being overweight or obese</li><li>Abdominal fluid</li><li>Lifting heavy items</li><li>Peritoneal dialysis</li><li>Poor nutrition</li><li>Smoking</li><li>Physical exertion</li><li>Undescended testicles</li><li>Lifting heavy objects without stabilizing the abdominal muscles</li><li>Diarrhea or constipation</li><li>Persistent coughing or sneezing</li><li>Inguinal and femoral hernias are due to weakened muscles that may have been present since birth, or are associated with aging and repeated strains on the abdominal and groin areas.</li><li>Such strain may come from physical exertion, obesity, pregnancy, frequent coughing, or straining on the toilet due to constipation.</li><li>Adults may get an umbilical hernia by straining the abdominal area, being overweight, having a long-lasting heavy cough or after giving birth.</li><li>The cause of Hiatal hernias is not fully understood, but a weakening of the diaphragm with age or pressure on the abdomen could play a part.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><strong>SYMPTOMS:-</strong></p><ul><li>A hernia in the abdomen or groin can produce a noticeable lump or bulge that can be pushed back in, or that can disappear when lying down.</li><li>Laughing, crying, coughing, straining during a bowel movement, or physical activity may make the lump reappear after it has been pushed in.</li><li>In the case of Hiatal hernias, there are no bulges on the outside of the body.</li><li>Instead, symptoms may include heartburn, indigestion, difficulty swallowing, frequent regurgitation (bringing food back up) and chest pain.</li></ul><p>More symptoms of a hernia include:</p><ul><li>Swelling or bulge in the groin or scrotum (the pouch that contains the testicles)</li><li>Increased pain at the site of the bulge</li><li>Pain while lifting</li><li>Increase in the bulge size over time</li><li>A dull aching sensation</li><li>A sense of feeling full or signs of bowel obstruction</li></ul>

<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><p>Hernias usually do not get better on their own and surgery may be the only way to repair them.</p><p>&nbsp;In the case of an umbilical hernia in a child, surgery may be recommended if the hernia is large or if it has not healed by the age of 4&ndash;5 years old. By this age, a child can usually avoid surgical complications.</p><p>If an adult has an umbilical hernia, surgery is usually recommended because the condition will not likely improve on its own and the risk of complications is higher.</p><p>One of three types of hernia surgery can be performed:</p><ul><li><strong>Open surgery</strong>, in which a cut is made into the body at the location of the hernia. The protruding tissue is set back in place and the weakened muscle wall is stitched back together. Sometimes a type of mesh is implanted in the area to provide extra support.</li><li><strong>Laparoscopic surgery</strong> involves the same type of repairs. However, instead of a cut to the outside of the abdomen or groin, tiny incisions are made to allow for the insertion of surgical tools to complete the procedure.</li><li><strong>Robotic hernia repair</strong><strong>,</strong> like laparoscopic surgery, uses a laparoscope and is performed with small incisions. With robotic surgery, the surgeon is seated at a console in the operating room and handles the surgical instruments from the console. While robotic surgery can be used for some smaller hernias or weak areas, it can now also be used to reconstruct the abdominal wall.</li></ul>




--------------------RESPIRATORY-----------------
-----------ASTHMA-----------------
<p><strong>Asthma</strong></p><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out, and shortness of breath. Severe asthma can cause trouble talking or being active. You might hear your doctor call it a chronic respiratory disease. Some people refer to asthma as bronchial asthma.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the most common chronic condition among American children: 1 child out of every 12 has asthma</p><h2><strong>Types</strong></h2><p>Asthma can occur in many different ways and for many different reasons, but the triggers are often the same. They include airborne pollutants, viruses, pet dander, mold, and cigarette smoke.</p><h3><strong>Childhood asthma</strong></h3><p>Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children. It can develop at any age, but it is slightly more common in children than in adults. According to the American Lung Association, some common triggers of childhood asthma include:</p><ul><li>respiratory infections and colds</li><li>cigarette smoke, including secondhand tobacco smoke</li><li>allergens</li><li>air pollutants, including ozone and particle pollution, both indoors and outside</li><li>exposure to cold air</li><li>sudden changes in temperature</li><li>excitement</li><li>stress</li><li>exercise</li></ul><p>In some cases, asthma may improve as the child reaches adulthood. For many people, however, it is a lifelong condition.</p><h3><strong>Adult-onset asthma</strong></h3><p>Asthma can develop at any age, including during adulthood. Some factors that affect the risk of developing asthma in adulthood include:</p><ul><li>respiratory illness</li><li>allergies and exposure to allergens</li><li>hormonal factors</li><li>obesity</li><li>stress</li><li>Smoking</li></ul><p><strong>Occupational asthma</strong></p><p>Occupational asthma results&nbsp;from exposure to an allergen or irritant present in the workplace. In the following occupations, irritants can trigger asthma symptoms:</p><ul><li>car repairs and manufacturing</li><li>engineering and metalwork</li><li>woodwork and carpentry</li><li>electronics and assembly industries</li><li>hairdressing salons</li><li>indoor swimming pools</li></ul><h3><strong>Seasonal asthma</strong></h3><p>This type of asthma occurs in response to allergens that are only in the surrounding environment at certain times of the year. For example, cold air in the winter or pollen in the spring or summer may trigger symptoms of seasonal asthma. People with seasonal asthma still have the condition for the rest of the year, but they usually do not experience symptoms.</p><p><strong>Causes:</strong></p><p>Health professionals do not know exactly what causes asthma, but genetic and environmental factors both seem to play significant roles.</p><p>A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:</p><ul><ul><li>Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling</li><li>Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis &mdash; which causes red, itchy skin &mdash; or hay fever &mdash; which causes a runny nose, congestion, and itchy eyes</li><li>Being overweight</li><li>Being a smoker</li><li>Exposure to secondhand smoke</li><li>Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution</li></ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing, and manufacturing</strong></li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times &mdash; such as when exercising &mdash; or have symptoms all the time.</p><ul><li>coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise</li><li>tightness in the chest</li><li>shortness of breath</li><li>difficulty talking</li><li>anxiousness or panic</li><li>Fatigue</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>A doctor will ask the person about their symptoms, their family medical history, and their personal medical history. They will also carry out a physical examination, and they may conduct some other tests.</p><p><strong>Physical exam: </strong>Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. You may also be given a skin test to look for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or eczema. Allergies increase your risk of asthma.</p><p><strong>Lung Function Tests</strong>: These asthma tests see how well your lungs work.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spirometry</strong>: This simple breathing test measures how much air you blow out and how fast.&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>Peak flow</strong>: It can help you know what makes your asthma worse, whether your treatment is working, and when you need emergency care.</li><li><strong>Exhaled nitric oxide test. </strong>You&rsquo;ll breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath. Your body makes this gas normally, but levels could be high if your airways are inflamed.</li></ul><p><strong>Chest X-Ray: </strong>By viewing an X-ray of your lungs, your doctor can see if asthma is likely to be causing your symptoms.</p><p><strong>Sinuses</strong>: Your doctor may order a special sinus X-ray, called a CT scan, to examine your sinuses if they think you have an infection. If you have sinusitis, you will be treated with antibiotics for at least 10 to 12 days. Treating sinusitis may help prevent asthma symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p><p>There is no cure for asthma, but symptoms can be controlled with effective asthma treatment and management. This involves taking your medications as directed and learning to avoid triggers that cause your asthma symptoms.</p><p>Treatments for asthma fall into three primary categories:</p><ul><li><strong>breathing exercises</strong>: These exercises can help you get more air into and out of your lungs. Over time, this may help increase lung capacity and cut down on severe asthma symptoms.</li><li><strong>quick-acting treatments:</strong> These medications should only be used in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.</li><li><strong>long-term asthma control medications:</strong> These medications, taken daily, help reduce the number and severity of your asthma symptoms, but they don&rsquo;t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack. Long-term asthma control medications include the following: Anti-inflammatories, Anticholinergics, Long-acting bronchodilators, Biologic therapy drugs.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Your doctor will recommend one treatment or combination of treatments based on:</p><ul><li>the type of asthma you have</li><li>your age</li><li>your triggers</li></ul><h3><strong>Avoid your triggers</strong></h3><p>Taking steps to reduce your exposure to asthma triggers is a key part of asthma control. To reduce your exposure, you should:</p><ul><li><strong>Use your air conditioner: </strong>&nbsp;Air conditioning reduces the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds that find its way indoors. If you don't have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during the pollen season.</li><li><strong>Decontaminate your decor:</strong> Minimize dust that may worsen nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom. Use washable curtains and blinds.</li><li><strong>Maintain optimal humidity:</strong> If you live in a damp climate, talk to your doctor about using a dehumidifier.</li><li><strong>Prevent mold spores:</strong> Clean damp areas in the bathroom, kitchen, and around the house.</li><li><strong>Reduce pet dander:</strong> If you're allergic to dander, avoid pets with fur or feathers.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Clean regularly:</strong> Clean your home at least once a week.</li><li><strong>Cover your nose and mouth if it's cold out.</strong> If your asthma is worsened by cold or dry air, wearing a face mask can help.</li></ul>



--------------Bronchitis--------------------------

<h2><strong>Overview:</strong></h2><p>Bronchitis is when the tubes that carry air to your lungs, called the bronchial tubes, get inflamed and swollen. You end up with a nagging cough and mucus. Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.</p><p>Acute bronchitis develops from a cold or other respiratory infection and often improves within a few days without lasting effects. Chronic bronchitis is a more serious condition that develops over time rather than striking suddenly. It&rsquo;s characterized by recurrent episodes of bronchitis that last for several months or years.</p><p>The constant inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes causes excessive amounts of sticky mucus to build up in the airways. This restricts the amount of airflow going into and out of the lungs. The blockage in airflow gets worse over time, resulting in breathing difficulties and increased mucus production in the lungs.</p><h2><strong>Causes</strong></h2><p>The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis.&nbsp;</p><p>Chronic bronchitis causes include:</p><ul><li>Breathing in air pollution and other things that bother your lungs, like chemical fumes or dust, over time</li><li>Smoking or breathing in secondhand smoke for a long time</li></ul><h2>Risk factors</h2><p>Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include:</p><ul><li><strong>Cigarette smoke.</strong> People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.</li><li><strong>Low resistance.</strong> This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.</li><li><strong>Exposure to irritants on the job.</strong> Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.</li><li><strong>Gastric reflux.</strong> Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.</li></ul>

<h2>Symptoms:</h2><p>Signs and symptoms of both acute and chronic bronchitis include:</p><ul><li>a persistent cough, which may produce mucus</li><li>wheezing</li><li>a low fever and chills</li><li>a feeling of tightness in the chest</li><li>a sore throat</li><li>body aches</li><li>breathlessness</li><li>headaches</li><li>a blocked nose and sinuses</li></ul><p>However, bronchitis is not the only condition that causes a cough. A cough that refuses to go away may be a sign of asthma, pneumonia, or many other conditions. Anyone with a persistent cough should see a doctor for a diagnosis.</p><h2><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></h2><p>During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of bronchitis from those of a common cold.A doctor will carry out a physical examination, using a stethoscope to listen for unusual sounds in the lungs.</p><ul><li>A chest X-ray can help rule out other lung conditions, such as pneumonia, that may be causing your cough.</li><li>Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. Testing and analyzing the sputum can confirm the presence of bacteria and help your doctor determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.</li><li>A pulmonary function test allows your doctor to evaluate how well your lungs are functioning. It can check for signs of asthma or emphysema by measuring how well you&rsquo;re able to breathe and how easily your lungs are able to send oxygen to the rest of your body.</li><li>During a CT scan, your doctor takes high-resolution X-rays of your body from various angles, allowing your doctor to see your lungs and other organs in more detail.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>Although there&rsquo;s no cure for chronic bronchitis, the disease can be managed with medical treatment and lifestyle adjustments, especially when a diagnosis is made early on. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if your doctor simply recommends rest and lots of fluids. About acute bronchitis will often fade away on its own. Letting your body rest and drinking plenty of fluids may help it disappear more quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>The symptoms of chronic bronchitis may resolve or improve for a while. However, they will come back or become worse again, especially if there is exposure to smoke or other triggers.</p><p>Options that may help include:</p><ul><li>Cough medicine: Coughing is useful for removing mucus from the bronchial tubes, but medication can help bring relief, for example, at night.</li></ul><ul><li>Taking honey: Taking 2 spoonfuls of honey may bring relief of cough symptoms.</li><li>Using a humidifier: This can loosen mucus, improve airflow, and relieve wheezing.</li><li>Bronchodilators: These open the bronchial tubes and may help clear out mucus.</li><li>Mucolytics: These loosen or thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up sputum.</li><li>Anti-inflammatory and steroid drugs: These can help reduce inflammation that can cause tissue damage.</li><li>Oxygen therapy: In severe cases, a person may need supplemental oxygen to ease their breathing.</li></ul><h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2><p>It is not always possible to prevent acute or chronic bronchitis, but several things can reduce the risk.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li>avoiding or quit smoking</li><li>avoiding lung irritants, such as smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution</li><li>wearing a mask to cover the nose and mouth when pollution levels are high</li><li>washing the hands often to limit exposure to germs and bacteria</li><li>asking about vaccinations to protect from pneumonia and the flu</li></ul>


----------------------Pneumonia---------------------------


<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>Pneumonia is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it.</p><p>The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. That&rsquo;s because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it. In the United States (U.S.), around 1 million people are treated in the hospital for pneumonia each year, and around 50,000 die from the disease.</p><p>The germs that cause pneumonia are contagious. This means they can spread from person to person.</p><p>Both viral and bacterial pneumonia can spread to others through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough. You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.</p><p><strong>Causes:</strong></p><p>There are several types of infectious agents that can cause pneumonia.</p><h3>Bacterial pneumonia: The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. Other causes include:</h3><ul><li>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</li><li><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em></li><li>Legionella pneumophila</li></ul><h3>Viral pneumonia: Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Some examples include:</h3><ul><li>influenza (flu)</li><li>respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</li><li>rhinoviruses (common cold)</li></ul><p>Viral pneumonia is usually milder and can improve in one to three weeks without treatment.</p><p>Fungal pneumonia: Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems.</p>

<h3>Symptoms:&nbsp;</h3><p>Pneumonia symptoms can be mild to life-threatening. They can include:</p><ul><li>cough</li><li>rusty or green phlegm, or sputum, coughed up from lungs</li><li>fever</li><li>fast breathing and shortness of breath</li><li>shaking chills</li><li>chest pain that usually worsens when taking a deep breath, known as pleuritic pain</li><li>fast heartbeat</li><li>fatigue and weakness</li><li>nausea and vomiting</li><li>diarrhea</li><li>sweating</li><li>headache</li><li>muscle pain</li><li>confusion or delirium, especially in older adults</li><li>dusky or purplish skin color, or cyanosis, from poorly oxygenated blood</li></ul><p>Symptoms can vary depending on other underlying conditions and the type of pneumonia.</p><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>Your doctor will start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for abnormal bubbling or crackling sounds that suggest pneumonia.Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk for complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk for complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:</p><ul><li><strong>Chest X-ray: </strong>This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.</li><li><strong>Blood cultures:</strong> It may reveal whether the microorganism from the lungs has spread into the bloodstream.</li><li><strong>An arterial blood gas (ABG): </strong>This type of blood test may provide a more accurate reading of the body&rsquo;s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and other factors.</li><li><strong>Sputum analysis: </strong>It can determine which organism is causing the pneumonia.</li><li><strong>CT scan</strong>: If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.</li><li><strong>Pleural fluid culture:</strong> A fluid sample is taken by putting a needle between your ribs from the pleural area and analyzed to help determine the type of infection.</li><li><strong>Bronchoscopy: </strong>A bronchoscopy looks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that&rsquo;s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Treatment:</strong></h3><p>Treatment depends on the type and severity of the pneumonia.</p><ul><li>Bacterial types of pneumonia are usually treated with antibiotics.</li><li>Viral types of pneumonia are usually treated with rest and plenty of fluids. Antiviral medications can be used in influenza.</li><li>Fungal types of pneumonia are usually treated with antifungal medications.</li></ul><p>If it becomes severe, you may have to stay in the hospital for treatment. While you&rsquo;re there, your doctor will probably give you fluids or antibiotics through an IV tube. You may even need oxygen therapy or breathing treatments.</p><p><strong>Pneumonia prevention</strong></p><p>In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented.</p><h3><strong>Vaccination</strong></h3><p>The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.</p><p>In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can to avoid pneumonia:</p><ul><li>If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.</li><li>Regularly wash your hands with soap and water.</li><li>Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues.</li><li>Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, and get regular exercise.</li></ul>


----------------------------Tuberculosis-----------------------------


<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes. A person may develop TB after inhaling <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (<em>M. tuberculosis</em>) bacteria. A person may never experience symptoms and be unaware that they have the infection. There is also no risk of passing on a latent infection to another person. The risk of developing active TB is higher in:</p><ul><li>anyone with a weakened immune system</li><li>anyone who first developed the infection in the past 2&ndash;5 years</li><li>older adults and young children</li><li>people who use injected recreational drugs</li><li>people who have not received appropriate treatment for TB in the past&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Causes:</p><p>Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air. This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs, or sings.</p><p>The risk of getting pulmonary TB is highest for people who are in close contact with those who have TB. This includes being around family or friends with TB or working in places such as the following that often house people with TB:</p><ul><li>correctional facilities</li><li>group homes</li><li>nursing homes</li><li>hospitals</li><li>shelters</li></ul><p>People also at risk for developing pulmonary TB disease are:</p><ul><li>older adults</li><li>small children</li><li>people who smoke</li><li>people with an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis</li><li>people with lifelong conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease</li><li>people who inject drugs</li><li>people who are immunocompromised, such as those living with HIV, undergoing chemotherapy&nbsp;or taking chronic steroids</li></ul><p>Symp risk for getting pulmonary TB is highest for people who are in close contact with those who have TB. This includes being around family or friends with TB or working in places such as the following that often house people with TB:</p><ul><li>correctional facilities</li><li>group homes</li><li>nursing homes</li><li>hospitals</li><li>shelters</li></ul><p>People also at risk for developing pulmonary TB disease are:</p><ul><li>older adults</li><li>small children</li><li>people who smoke</li><li>people with an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis</li><li>people with lifelong conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease</li><li>people who inject drugs</li><li>people who are immunocompromised, such as those living with chemotherapy&nbsp;or taking chronic steroids</li></ul>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3><p>if you have tuberculosis, you may not have any symptoms. That&rsquo;s because the germs that cause this illness can live in your body without making you sick. In fact, most people who get infected with TB are able to fight the germs before they spread. Doctors call this &ldquo;latent TB&rdquo; infection.</p><p>But if the germs begin to multiply, you&rsquo;ll become sick with tuberculosis. Doctors call this &ldquo;active TB.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Coughing up blood or mucus</li><li>Weakness or fatigue</li><li>Fever</li><li>Night sweats</li><li>chest pains</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>During the physical exam, your doctor will check your lymph nodes for swelling and use a stethoscope to listen carefully to the sounds your lungs make while you breathe. Two tests can show whether TB bacteria are present:</p><ul><li>the TB skin test</li><li>the TB blood test</li></ul><p>However, these cannot indicate whether TB is active or latent. To test for active TB disease, the doctor may recommend a sputum test and a chest X-ray. Everyone with TB needs treatment, regardless of whether the infection is active or latent.</p>

<p>Treatment:</p><p>With the proper treatment, tuberculosis (TB, for short) is almost always curable. Medications are the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. But treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections.</p><p>For active tuberculosis, you must take antibiotics for at least six to nine months. The exact drugs and length of treatment depend on your age, overall health, possible drug resistance, and the infection's location in the body.</p><p>If you have drug-resistant TB, a combination of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones and injectable medications It is essential to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms go away. If a person stops taking their medication early, some bacteria can survive and become resistant to antibiotics. In this case, the person may go on to develop drug-resistant TB.</p><h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2><p>Ways of preventing TB from infecting others include:</p><ul><li>getting a diagnosis and treatment early</li><li>staying away from other people until there is no longer a risk of infection</li><li>wearing a mask, covering the mouth, and ventilating rooms</li></ul><h3><strong>TB vaccination</strong></h3><p>In some countries, children receive an anti-TB vaccination &mdash; the Bacillus Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine &mdash; as part of a regular immunization program.</p><p>However, experts in the U.S. do not recommend BCG inoculation for most people unless they have a high risk of TB. Some of the reasons include a low risk of infection in the country and a high likelihood that the vaccine will interfere with any future TB skin tests.</p><h2><strong>Preventing the Spread of TB</strong></h2><p>If you have active TB of the lungs, you can infect other people. For that reason, your doctor will tell you to stay home during the first few weeks of treatment, until you&rsquo;re no longer contagious. During that time, you should avoid public places and people with weakened immune systems, like young children, the elderly, and people with HIV. You&rsquo;ll have to wear a special mask if you have visitors or need to go to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>


-------------------Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD)----------------------


<p><strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD)</strong></p><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly referred to as COPD, is a group of progressive lung diseases. It is a long-term lung condition that makes it hard for you to breathe.</p><p>Although you can&rsquo;t reverse the lung damage, medication, and lifestyle changes can help you manage the symptoms. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema both can result in COPD. A COPD diagnosis means you may have one of these lung-damaging diseases or symptoms of both.&nbsp;</p><p>Emphysema is the breakdown of the walls of the tiny air sacs (alveoli) at the end of the bronchial tubes, in the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of the lung.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COPD affects nearly 16 million Americans or about 6% of the U.S. population.</strong></p><p><strong>Causes:</strong></p><p>Smoking tobacco causes up to 90% of COPD cases. About 90 percent of people who have COPD are smokers or former smokers. Other causes include:</p><ul><ul><li>Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a genetic disorder.</li><li>Secondhand smoke.</li><li>Air pollution.</li><li>Workplace dust and fumes.</li><li>Your genes</li></ul></ul><ul><li><strong><strong>Asthma</strong></strong></li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>COPD symptoms often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues. At first, symptoms of COPD can be quite mild. You might mistake them for a cold.</p><p>Early symptoms include:</p><ul><li>occasional shortness of breath, especially after exercise</li><li>mild but recurrent cough</li><li>needing to clear your throat often, especially first thing in the morning</li></ul><p>As the lungs become more damaged, you may experience:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities</li><li>Wheezing</li><li>Chest tightness</li><li>A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish</li><li>Frequent respiratory infections</li><li>Lack of energy</li><li>Unintended weight loss (in later stages)</li><li>Swelling in ankles, feet or legs</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>Finding out whether you have COPD can take several steps. This includes talking with your doctor and getting tests, many of which are straightforward and painless. When you visit the doctor, be sure to mention all of your symptoms. Tell your doctor if:</p><ul><li>you&rsquo;re a smoker or have smoked in the past</li><li>you&rsquo;re exposed to lung irritants on the job</li><li>you&rsquo;re exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke</li><li>you have a family history of COPD</li><li>you have asthma or other respiratory conditions</li><li>you take over-the-counter or prescription medications</li></ul><p><strong>Stethoscope:</strong> You may see your doctor wearing one around her neck. She will place the instrument on your chest to listen for anything unusual such as wheezing. Based on what she hears, she may recommend more tests.</p><p><strong>Spirometry:&nbsp;</strong>Spirometry is a noninvasive test to assess lung function. During the test, you&rsquo;ll take a deep breath and then blow into a tube connected to the spirometer</p><p><strong>Chest X-ray: </strong>This creates an image of your chest, including your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This shows whether there are problems in the lungs, including other diseases such as pneumonia, cancer, and heart failure</p><p><strong>Arterial Blood Gas</strong>: An arterial blood gas test involves taking a blood sample from an artery to measure your blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other important levels.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p><p>The goal of treating COPD is to help you breathe easier and get you back to your regular activities. Your doctor has a number of options to choose from. Your healthcare team may include a lung specialist (pulmonologist) and physical and respiratory therapists.</p><p><strong>Medication:&nbsp;</strong>medications work quickly to relax the muscles around your airways and ease symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. You take them through an inhaler. The effects last for about 4 to 6 hours. You use them only when you have symptoms, or before you exercise.</p><p><strong>Oxygen therapy: </strong>If your blood oxygen level is too low, you can receive supplemental oxygen through a mask or nasal cannula to help you breathe better. A portable unit can make it easier to get around.</p><p><strong>Steroids: </strong>These bring down the swelling in your airways. You usually breathe them in through an inhaler. Inhaled steroids can help if you have many COPD flare-ups. You might take steroids as a pill if your symptoms get worse.</p><p><strong>Surgery: </strong>Surgery is reserved for severe COPD or when other treatments have failed, which is more likely when you have a form of severe emphysema.</p><p>One type of surgery is called bullectomy. During this procedure, surgeons remove large, abnormal air spaces (bullae) from the lungs.</p><p>Another is lung volume reduction surgery, which removes damaged upper lung tissue.</p><p>Lung transplantation is an option in some cases.</p><p><strong>Antibiotics: </strong>An infection can make your COPD symptoms worse. Your doctor will give you antibiotics to kill the bacteria and treat the infection.</p><p>Take all the medicine you're prescribed. If you stop taking the antibiotics too early, the infection could come back.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Changes</strong></p><p>Certain lifestyle changes may also help alleviate your symptoms or provide relief.</p><p><strong>Cigarette smoke</strong> is the leading cause of COPD, and it can make the disease worse. It may not be easy for you to quit, but there are many ways to get help. Ask your doctor about nicotine replacement, medicine, and counseling.</p><p><strong>Talk to a dietitian:&nbsp;</strong>Get the nutrition your body needs. Work with your doctor or dietician to create a healthy eating plan.</p><p><strong>Exercise.</strong> This is also important when you have COPD. It strengthens the muscles that help you breathe.</p><p>Your doctor can help you design a fitness program that's safe for you. You'll also learn breathing techniques to help you exercise.</p>


-------------------------SWINE FLU -----------------------------------------------


<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>H1N1 flu is also known as swine flu. It's called swine flu because in the past, the people who caught it had direct contact with pigs. Swine flu can affect both pigs and humans. It is a respiratory disease that results from an influenza A virus.</p><p>In 2009, H1N1 was spreading fast around the world, so the World Health Organization called it a pandemic. It continues to spread during flu season like other strains of the flu. Like other strains of the flu, H1N1 is highly contagious, allowing it to spread quickly from person to person. A simple sneeze can cause thousands of germs to spread through the air. The virus can linger on tables and surface areas like doorknobs, waiting to be picked up.</p><p>Causes:</p><p>Swine flu is caused by a strain of influenza virus that usually only infects pigs. Unlike typhus, which can be transmitted by lice or ticks, the transmission usually occurs from person to person, not animal to person.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t catch swine flu from eating properly cooked pork products</p><p>Swine farmers and veterinarians have the highest risk of exposure to true swine flu because they work with and are near pigs.</p><h2>Complications</h2><p>Influenza complications include:</p><ul><li>Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma</li><li>Pneumonia</li><li>Neurological signs and symptoms, ranging from confusion to seizures</li><li>Respiratory failure</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2><p>The signs and symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of infections caused by other flu strains and can include:</p><ul><li>chills</li><li>fever</li><li>coughing</li><li>sore throat</li><li>runny or stuffy nose</li><li>body aches</li><li>fatigue</li><li>diarrhea</li><li>nausea and vomiting</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>To diagnose flu, including swine flu, your doctor will likely conduct a physical exam, look for signs and symptoms of influenza, and possibly order a test that detects influenza viruses.</p><p>Your doctor can make a diagnosis by sampling fluid from your body. To take a sample, your doctor or a nurse may swab your nose or throat.</p><p>The swab will be analyzed using various genetic and laboratory techniques to identify the specific type of virus.</p>

<h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>Some of the same antiviral drugs that are used to treat seasonal flu also work against H1N1 swine flu. Most cases of swine flu don&rsquo;t require medication for treatment. You don&rsquo;t need to see a doctor unless you&rsquo;re at risk of developing medical complications from the flu. You should focus on relieving your symptoms and preventing the spread of the H1N1 to other people.</p><p>Antibiotics won't do anything for you. That&rsquo;s because the flu is caused by a virus, not bacteria. Over-the-counter pain remedies and cold and flu medications can help relieve aches, pains, and fever. Don't give aspirin to children under age 18 because of the risk of Reye&rsquo;s syndrome. Make sure that over-the-counter cold medications do not have aspirin before giving them to children.</p><h2><strong>Lifestyle and home remedies</strong></h2><p>If you develop any type of flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:</p><ul><li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids.</strong> Choose water, juice, and warm soups to prevent dehydration.</li><li><strong>Rest.</strong> Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.</li><li><strong>Consider pain relievers.</strong> Use an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), cautiously. Also, use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers.</li></ul><h2><strong>Preventing swine flu</strong></h2><p>The best way to prevent swine flu is to get a yearly flu vaccination. Other easy ways to prevent swine flu include:</p><ul><li>frequently washing hands with soap or hand sanitizer</li><li>not touching your nose, mouth, or eyes (The virus can survive on surfaces like telephones and tabletops.)</li><li>staying home from work or school if you&rsquo;re ill</li><li>avoiding large gatherings when swine flu is in season</li></ul>




-------------------------KIDNEY-------------------------------------
---------------CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE----------------------------------

<p><strong>CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</strong></p><p><strong>Summary:-</strong></p><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also called chronic kidney failure it describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes, and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.</p><p><strong>Causes:-</strong></p><p>The two main causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure, which are responsible for up to two-thirds of the cases. Diabetes happens when your blood sugar is too high, causing damage to many organs in your body, including the kidneys and heart, as well as blood vessels, nerves and eyes</p><p>It also occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or year</p>


<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Nausea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Fatigue and weakness</li><li>Sleep problems</li><li>Changes in how much you urinate</li><li>Decreased mental sharpness</li><li>Muscle twitches and cramps</li><li>Swelling of feet and ankles</li><li>Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart</li><li>Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs</li><li>High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to contro<strong>l</strong></li></ul>


<p><strong>Treatment:-</strong></p><p>Treatment can be merely classified four main categories:-</p><p>&Oslash;Medical procedure</p><p>&Oslash;Self-care</p><p>&Oslash;Medications</p><p>&Oslash;Surgery</p><p><strong>Medical procedure:-</strong></p><p>1. Peritoneal dialysis -</p><p>A home-based therapy that uses the natural lining of the abdomen as a filter to clean the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so.</p><p>2. Hemofiltration -</p><p>Using filters outside the body to clean the blood when the kidneys are injured.</p><p>3. Dialysis &ndash;</p><p>Using a machine to clean the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so.</p><p><strong>SELF CARE:-</strong></p><p><strong>Low protein diet :</strong></p><p>A diet that reduces the consumption of meats, fish, and cheese used to treat certain kidney and metabolic diseases.</p><p><strong>MEDICATION:-</strong></p><ul><li>Vitamin</li><li>Helps promote normal body function, growth, and development.</li><li>Calcium reducer</li><li>Decreases the amount of calcium in the blood.</li><li>Bone marrow stimulant</li><li>Helps bone marrow produce new blood cells.</li><li>Diuretic</li><li>Taking medicine that helps eliminate extra water from the body. It's also prescribed to treat high blood pressure.</li><li>Dietary supplement</li><li>Works alone or in conjunction with other treatments to promote health.</li></ul><p><strong>SURGERY:-</strong></p><p><strong>Kidney transplantation</strong></p><p>Surgical replacement of a diseased kidney with one from a living or deceased donor.</p>



---------------------KIDNEY STONE (nephrolithiasis)-------------------------
<p><strong>Summary</strong><strong>:-</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Kidneys remove waste and fluid from your blood to make urine. Sometimes, when you have too much of certain wastes and not enough fluid in your blood, these wastes can build up and stick together in your kidneys. These clumps of waste are called kidney stones also called nephrolithiasis. Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and acid salts that stick together in concentrated urine. They can be painful when passing through the urinary tract, but usually don't cause permanent damage. The most common symptom is severe pain, usually in the side of the abdomen, that's often associated with nausea.</p><p>Treatment includes pain relievers and drinking lots of water to help pass the stone. Medical procedures may be required to remove or break up larger stones.</p><p><strong>Causes:-</strong></p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t drink enough water.</li><li>Someone in your family has had kidney stones.</li><li>Follow a diet high in protein, sodium and/or sugar.</li><li>overweight or obese</li><li>If had gastric bypass surgery or another intestinal surgery.</li><li>Have polycystic kidney disease or another cystic kidney disease.</li><li>Have a certain condition that causes your urine to contain high levels of cystine, oxalate, uric acid or calcium.</li><li>Condition that causes swelling or irritation in your bowel or your joints.</li><li>You take certain medicines, such as diuretics (water pills) or calcium-based antacids.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Pain while urinating</li><li>Blood in your urine</li><li>Sharp pain in your back or lower abdomen</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Sweating</li></ul>

<p><strong>Treatment:-</strong></p><p>The best way to prevent most kidney stones is to drink enough water every day.</p><p>Small stones with minimal symptoms:-</p><p>Most small kidney stones won't require invasive treatment. You may be able to pass a small stone by:</p><ul><li>Drinking water. Drinking as much as water a day will keep your urine dilute and may prevent stones from forming. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, drink enough fluid,ideally mostly water ,to produce clear or nearly clear urine.</li><li>Pain relievers. Passing a small stone can cause some discomfort. To relieve mild pain, your doctor may recommend pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve).</li><li>Medical therapy. Your doctor may give you a medication to help pass your kidney stone. This type of medication, known as an alpha blocker, relaxes the muscles in your ureter, helping you pass the kidney stone more quickly and with less pain. Examples of alpha blockers include tamsulosin (Flomax) and the drug combination dutasteride and tamsulosin (Jalyn)</li></ul><p>Large stones symptoms:-</p><p>Kidney stones that are too large to pass on their own or cause bleeding, kidney damage or ongoing urinary tract infections may require more-extensive treatment. Procedures may include:</p><ul><li>Using sound waves to break up stones. For certain kidney stones &mdash; depending on size and location &mdash; your doctor may recommend a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).</li></ul><p>ESWL uses sound waves to create strong vibrations (shock waves) that break the stones into tiny pieces that can be passed in your urine. The procedure lasts about 45 to 60 minutes and can cause moderate pain, so you may be under sedation or light anesthesia to make you comfortable.</p><p>ESWL can cause blood in the urine, bruising on the back or abdomen, bleeding around the kidney and other adjacent organs, and discomfort as the stone fragments pass through the urinary tract.</p><ul><li>Surgery to remove very large stones in the kidney. A procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy involves surgically removing a kidney stone using small telescopes and instruments inserted through a small incision in your back.</li></ul><p>You will receive general anesthesia during the surgery and be in the hospital for one to two days while you recover. Your doctor may recommend this surgery if ESWL is unsuccessful.</p><ul><li>Using a scope to remove stones. To remove a smaller stone in your ureter or kidney, your doctor may pass a thin lighted tube (ureteroscope) equipped with a camera through your urethra and bladder to your ureter.</li></ul><p>Once the stone is located, special tools can snare the stone or break it into pieces that will pass in your urine. Your doctor may then place a small tube (stent) in the ureter to relieve swelling and promote healing. You may need general or local anesthesia during this procedure.</p><ul><li>Parathyroid gland surgery. Some calcium phosphate stones are caused by overactive parathyroid glands, which are located on the four corners of your thyroid gland, just below your Adam's apple. When these glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism), your calcium levels can become too high and kidney stones may form as a result.</li></ul><p>Hyperparathyroidism sometimes occurs when a small, benign tumor forms in one of your parathyroid glands or you develop another condition that leads these glands to produce more parathyroid hormone. Removing the growth from the gland stops the formation of kidney stones. Or your doctor may recommend treatment of the condition that's causing your parathyroid gland to overproduce the hormone.</p>


-----------------URINARY TRACT INFECTION ( UTI ) -----------------------

<p><strong>Summary:-</strong></p><p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) also called Bladder Infection is an infection in any part of your urinary system. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract the bladder and the urethra. Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. Infection limited to your bladder can be painful and annoying. However, serious consequences can occur if a UTI spreads to your kidneys. A bladder infection may cause pelvic pain, increased urge to urinate, pain with urination, and blood in the urine.</p><p>UTIs are usually classified as upper or lower according to where they occur along the urinary tract,</p><ul><li>Lower UTIs: Infections of the bladder (cystitis)</li><li>Upper UTIs: Infections of the kidneys (pyelonephritis)</li></ul><p><strong>Causes</strong><strong>:-</strong></p><p>Urinary tract infections typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. Women with diabetes may be at higher risk because their weakened immune systems make them less able to fight off infections.&nbsp;</p><p>The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.</p><ul><li>Infection of the bladder (cystitis). This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, sometimes other bacteria are responsible.</li></ul><p>Sexual intercourse may lead to cystitis, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop it. All women are at risk of cystitis because of their anatomy specifically, the short distance from the urethra to the anus and the urethral opening to the bladder.</p><ul><li>Infection of the urethra (urethritis). This type of UTI can occur when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. Also, because the female urethra is close to the vagina, sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma, can cause urethritis.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><p>Urinary tract infections don't always cause signs and symptoms, but when they do they may include:</p><ul><li>A strong, persistent urge to urinate</li><li>A burning sensation when urinating</li><li>Passing frequent, small amounts of urine</li><li>Urine that appears cloudy</li><li>Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored a sign of blood in the urine</li><li>Strong-smelling urine</li><li>Pelvic pain, in women especially in the center of the pelvis and around the area of the pubic bone</li></ul>


<p><strong>TREATMENT:-</strong></p><ul><li>Drink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that you'll urinate more frequently &mdash; allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin.</li><li>Drink cranberry juice. Although studies are not conclusive that cranberry juice prevents UTIs, it is likely not harmful.</li><li>Wipe from front to back. Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra.</li><li>Empty your bladder soon after intercourse. Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.</li><li>Avoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra.</li><li>Change your birth control method. Diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicide-treated condoms, can all contribute to bacterial growth</li></ul>


--------------Acute  kidney Failure (injury) -----------------------------


<p><strong>Summary:-</strong></p><p>When your kidneys stop working suddenly, over a very short period of time it is called acute kidney Failure or Acute Kidney failure or Acute Renal failure. It is very serious and requires immediate treatment. Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from your blood. When your kidneys lose their filtering ability, dangerous levels of wastes may accumulate, and your blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance. Acute kidney failure is most common in people who are already hospitalized, particularly in critically ill people who need intensive care. Acute kidney failure can be fatal and requires intensive treatment. However, acute kidney failure may be reversible. If you're otherwise in good health, you may recover normal or nearly normal kidney function.</p><p><strong>CAUSES:-</strong></p><p>Acute kidney Failure usually happens when your kidneys are damaged suddenly. The damage that leads to failure may be caused by:</p><ul><li>Not enough blood flowing through your kidneys</li><li>An injury directly to your kidneys or a problem with your kidneys</li><li>A blockage in your ureters, the tubes that take urine from your kidneys to your bladder</li><li>Low blood pressure</li><li>Bleeding too much</li><li>Having severe diarrhea</li><li>Heart disease or heart attack</li><li>Infection</li><li>Liver failure</li><li>Being very dehydrated (not having enough fluid in your body)</li><li>Severe allergic reaction</li><li>Blood clots in or around the kidneys</li><li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li><li>Some blood or blood vessel disorders</li></ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms:-</strong></p><ul><li>Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normal</li><li>Fluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feet</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Confusion</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Weakness</li><li>Irregular heartbeat</li><li>Chest pain or pressure</li><li>Seizures or coma in severe cases</li></ul>


<p><strong>Treatment:-</strong></p><p>Treatment depends on the type of kidney failure whereas most common treatment is</p><h3>&nbsp;Diet:-</h3><p>Your doctor will restrict your diet and the number of liquids you eat and drink. This will reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally eliminate. A diet high in carbohydrates and low in protein, salt, and potassium is usually recommended.</p><h3><strong>Medications:-</strong></h3><p>Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat or prevent any infections that occur at the same time. Diuretics may help your kidneys eliminate fluid. Calcium and insulin can help you avoid dangerous increases in your blood potassium levels.</p><h3><strong>Dialysis:-</strong></h3><p>You may need dialysis, but it&rsquo;s not always necessary, and it will likely only be temporary. Dialysis involves diverting blood out of your body into a machine that filters out waste. The clean blood then returns to your body. If your potassium levels are dangerously high, dialysis can save your life. Dialysis is necessary if there are changes in your mental status or if you stop urinating. You may also need dialysis if you develop pericarditis or inflammation of the heart. Dialysis can help eliminate nitrogen waste products from your body.</p>
