<p><strong>Causes:</strong>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><h3><strong>Chemical exposure: </strong>The most common and dangerous chemical which can cause blood cancer is benzene. Exposure to heavy factory smoke and chemicals, formaldehyde etc., can also lead to blood cancer.</h3><h3><strong>Radiation exposure: </strong>Blood cancer can also happen because of exposure to radiation. Radiation of certain wavelengths can destroy the DNA and can cause cancer. Higher the dose of radiation, greater the risk of developing blood cancer. Exposure to radiation as a part of radiotherapy to cure cancers and to imaging tests can increase the risk of developing blood cancer.</h3><p><strong>Chronic inflammation: </strong>Chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. It is important to determine why and where the inflammation has occurred and which type of inflammation it is. This information contributes to the detection and diagnosis of blood cancer.</p><h3><strong>Genetics:</strong>There are some symptoms which are inherited syndromes. These syndromes directly impact higher possibilities of developing cancer. They include Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, down syndrome and a few more.</h3><p><strong>Smoking: </strong>This is one of the most crucial risk factors for blood cancer. The wide belief is that smoking causes lung or mouth cancer only, but it is one of the major contributors for blood cancer too. The tobacco can severely damage or change the DNA of blood cells which leads to abnormal growth and malfunctioning of the cell causing blood cancer.</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Today, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population do not follow a nutritious diet, a few foods, however, increase the risk of cancer. They are Processed meat, Microwave popcorn, Aerated drinks, Diet food and beverages, Refined flour, Refined sugars, Dirty fruits and vegetables, Farmed salmon, Hydrogenated oils.</p>

It is one of the most reliable treatments to cure blood cancer. These drugs travel along the bloodstream to reach the cancer cells. They then restrict the cells from spreading cancer further in the body. This treatment becomes one of the most effective ones because these drugs attack the cancer cells that are dividing quickly.</li><li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong><strong>:</strong> This form of cancer treatment uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. The therapy works by damaging the DNA in the cells, which restricts their growth and reproduction.</li><li>Stem cell transplantation: Healthy stem cells can be infused into your body to help resume healthy blood production following therapy to destroy malignant blood cells. When the blood cells are critically affected and the functioning of the body declines, the body needs more than getting rid of cancerous cells.</li><li><strong>Cancer Surgery</strong><strong>:</strong> This treatment involves removing the affected lymph nodes to treat some lymphomas.</li></ul><p>Life After Treatment:</p><ul><li>Re-entry to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life takes time and adjustment. Allow yourself and your family time to get used to being together again and appreciate that there will be setbacks and challenges.</li><li>Talk to someone who understands your situation. Perhaps someone who has been through a similar experience to yours.</li><li>Think about what is the best next step for you. For some going back to work gives a sense of being productive and useful again. For others, time to &lsquo;take stock&rsquo; or go on a holiday are the best ways to get back on top of things.</li><li>Understand that your friends or work colleagues may feel uncomfortable discussing your illness and that you may need to &lsquo;break the ice&rsquo; first.</li><li>You may benefit from counseling as well for your mental relaxation.</li></ul>
