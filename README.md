<p><strong>Causes:</strong>The risk factors for blood cancer are not fully understood, though it is believed that blood cancers develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p><h3><strong>Chemical exposure: </strong>The most common and dangerous chemical which can cause blood cancer is benzene. Exposure to heavy factory smoke and chemicals, formaldehyde etc., can also lead to blood cancer.</h3><h3><strong>Radiation exposure: </strong>Blood cancer can also happen because of exposure to radiation. Radiation of certain wavelengths can destroy the DNA and can cause cancer. Higher the dose of radiation, greater the risk of developing blood cancer. Exposure to radiation as a part of radiotherapy to cure cancers and to imaging tests can increase the risk of developing blood cancer.</h3><p><strong>Chronic inflammation: </strong>Chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. It is important to determine why and where the inflammation has occurred and which type of inflammation it is. This information contributes to the detection and diagnosis of blood cancer.</p><h3><strong>Genetics:</strong>There are some symptoms which are inherited syndromes. These syndromes directly impact higher possibilities of developing cancer. They include Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, down syndrome and a few more.</h3><p><strong>Smoking: </strong>This is one of the most crucial risk factors for blood cancer. The wide belief is that smoking causes lung or mouth cancer only, but it is one of the major contributors for blood cancer too. The tobacco can severely damage or change the DNA of blood cells which leads to abnormal growth and malfunctioning of the cell causing blood cancer.</p><p><strong>Diet: </strong>Today, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population do not follow a nutritious diet, a few foods, however, increase the risk of cancer. They are Processed meat, Microwave popcorn, Aerated drinks, Diet food and beverages, Refined flour, Refined sugars, Dirty fruits and vegetables, Farmed salmon, Hydrogenated oils.</p>


<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p><p>The symptoms of blood cancer may often be ignored or overlooked. This is because they are nonspecific and can be usually explained by flu or other common illnesses.</p><ul><li>Fever</li><li>Chills</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Weakness</li><li>Bone and joint pain</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Headaches along with visual difficulties</li><li>Excessive or easy bruising</li><li>Frequent vomiting sensations</li><li>Decreased urination and difficulty while urinating</li><li>Abnormal bleeding in gums nose and cuts, which will lead to platelet reduction</li></ul><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p><p>The most common tests used to diagnose blood cancer are:</p><ul><li><h3><strong><strong>Complete blood count</strong></strong></h3></li></ul><p>A complete blood count (CBC) is a commonly performed lab test that measures the number of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, and gives the amount of hemoglobin in the blood (hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen), and the percentage of blood that is RBCs.</p><p>Blood chemistry, which may also be called a chemistry panel, is commonly performed to measure a person&rsquo;s health status. Abnormal levels of certain elements in the blood (like electrolytes and some proteins) may be caused by cancer,</p><ul><li><h2><strong><strong>Lymph node biopsy</strong></strong></h2></li></ul><p>A lymph node or a part of one is removed through a surgical procedure. In some cases, a biopsy sample can be taken with a needle, however, the results are typically more conclusive with an open (surgical) biopsy.</p><ul><li><h2><strong><strong>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</strong></strong></h2></li></ul><p>The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are samples of bone marrow that are taken usually from the hip (pelvic) bone. The aspiration uses a large, hollow needle to remove some of the liquid bone marrow. The bone marrow biopsy is done at the same time with a large needle that is twisted in to remove a small piece of bone, as well as marrow.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><h3><strong><strong>Flow cytometry</strong></strong></h3></li></ul><p>This test determines the blood and bone marrow cells to analyze a change in the white blood cell count that could cause cancer.</p><ul><li><h2><strong><strong>Imaging tests</strong></strong></h2></li></ul><p>There are several different imaging tests that may be used during diagnosis or staging of blood cancer, including: x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance image (MRI).</p>
